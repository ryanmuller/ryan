For chess, deliberate practice includes deep analysis of grandmaster games. You take an annotated grandmaster chess game  say, from Bobby Fishers My 60 Memorable Games  make the first few moves, then cover up the grandmaster analysis and try to figure out the move the grandmaster is about to make. If your candidate move matches the grandmaster move, great  move on to the next position in the game! If they do not match, try to figure out what the grandmaster understood that you did not. If you cannot figure it out, study the analysis in the annotations. Then repeat from step 1 with the next position.

This work is hard. But it is necessary. And it is productive. Canadian chessplayer Peter Biyiasas is said to have become an International Master by studying just two books, one of which was Fishers My 60 Memorable Games.

The power of deliberate practice is the message of the paper, The Role of Deliberate Practice in Chess Expertise (Applied Cognitive Psychology19:151165 (2005)). Authors Neil Charness and co-workers studied the effect of different types of chess practice on chess rating. Hours of deliberate practice were a factor of 6 more effective than hours of regular practice (playing tournament games).
