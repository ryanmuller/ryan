Contextual inquiry (CI) is a user-centered design (UCD) ethnographic research method, part of the Contextual Design methodology. A contextual inquiry interview is usually structured as an approximately two-hour, one-on-one interaction in which the researcher watches the user do their normal activities and discusses what they see with the user.

Contextual inquiry defines four principles to guide the interaction:

ContextInterviews are conducted in the users actual workplace. The researcher watches users do their own work tasks and discusses any artifacts they generate or use with them. In addition, the researcher gathers detailed re-tellings of specific past events when they are relevant to the project focus.

PartnershipUser and researcher collaborate to understand the users work. The interview alternates between observing the user as they work and discussing what the user did and why.

InterpretationThe researcher shares their interpretations and insights with the user during the interview. The user may expand or correct the researchers understanding.

FocusThe researcher steers the interaction towards topics which are relevant to the teams scope. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry|Contextual inquiry - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]

A contextual interview generally has three phases, which may not be formally separated in the interview itself:

The introductionThe researcher introduces him or herself and shares their design focus. They may request permission to record and start recording. They promise confidentiality to the user. They solicit a high-level overview of the users work. They agree with the user on the specific tasks the user will work on during the interview.

The body of the interviewThe researcher observes the work and discusses what they see. They take notes, usually handwritten of everything that happens.

The wrap-upThe researcher summarizes what they learned from the interview, offering the user a chance to give final corrections and clarifications. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry|Contextual inquiry - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]

Following a contextual inquiry field interview, the method defines interpretation sessions as a way to analyze the data. In an interpretation session, 3-8 team members gather to hear the researcher re-tell the story of the interview in order. As the interview is re-told, the team individual insights and facts as notes. They also may capture representations of the users activities as work models (defined in the Contextual Design methodology). The notes may be organized using an affinity diagram. Many teams use the contextual data to generate in-depth personas. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry|Contextual inquiry - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]

The open-ended nature of the interaction makes it possible to reveal tacit knowledge, knowledge about their own work process that users themselves are not consciously aware of. Tacit knowledge has traditionally been very hard for researchers to uncover.

The information produced by contextual inquiry is highly reliable. Surveys and questionnaires assume the questions they include are important. Traditional usability tests assume the tasks the user is asked to perform are relevant. Contextual inquiries focus on the work users need to accomplish, done their wayso it is always relevant to the user. And because its their own work, the users are more committed to it than they would be to a sample task.

The information produced by contextual inquiry is highly detailed. Marketing methods such as surveys produce high-level information but not the detailed work practice data needed to design products. It is very difficult to get this level of detail any other way.

Contextual inquiry is a very flexible technique. Contextual inquiries have been conducted in homes, offices, operating theaters, automobiles, factory floors, construction sites, maintenance tunnels, and chip fabrication labs, among many other places.
