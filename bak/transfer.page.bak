<blockquote><html>Executive functions (EF) imply processes critical for purposeful, goal-directed behavior. In children, evidence derived from
                              laboratory measures indicates that training can improve EF. However, this hypothesis has never been explicitly examined based
                              on real-world measures, especially of educational achievement. Here, we investigate whether a set of computerized games might
                              yield transfer on low-socioeconomic status otherwise typically developing 6-y-olds in an intervention deployed at their own
                              school. The games elicit transfer of some EF, which cascades to real-world measures of school performance. More importantly,
                              the intervention equalizes academic outcomes across children who regularly attend school and those who do not because of social
                              and familiar circumstances.</html></blockquote>
