  * 2011-10-02 13:33:45 [@cen2006learning] is a great overview of LFA - separating out finer components from tutor data #[[cognitive_model]]
  * 2011-10-02 23:00:01 spent the day on a 'video highligher' web app #[[learnstream]]
  * 2011-10-03 15:05:30 created a stripped down version of khan exercises that could be used for research #[[learning_from_video]]
  * 2011-10-03 16:29:31 really interesting point in [@chi2008three] -- categorical shifts are difficult because they are uncommon; maybe easier for experts since they do a lot of difficult problems (thinking of physics categorization in particular)? #[[conceptual_change]]
  * 2011-10-03 16:43:57 [@chi2008three] gives nice overview of different types of conceptual change #[[conceptual_change]]
  * 2011-10-06 17:53:12 finished Stories of Your Life -- very imaginative stories covering mind, time, religion, and other nice scifi kinda stuff #[[books_read]]
  * 2011-10-07 16:32:39 Bryan gave a nice talk on analogy, explaning [@gick1983schema] -- in his terms analogy and contrast are two types of comparison: analogy usually better at early stages and contrast later #[[analogy]]
  * 2011-10-07 19:29:01 Why do we take a long time to learn some things? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-07 19:29:55 Is there something about discovery learning unachieveable with direct instruction? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-08 21:52:08 Is there any work at the intersection of HCI and algorithmic game theory? #[[hci]]
  * 2011-10-08 22:07:36 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps5aYsG8jY0 #[[game_theory]]
  * 2011-10-09 18:09:25 What's the relationship between declarative memory structures and KCs from KLI? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-09 18:10:10 What's the difference between declarative and procedural memory? Do production rules use declarative structures? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-09 18:11:10 Is lots of deliberate practice sufficient/necessary for conceptual change learning? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-09 18:33:57 How do we use 'cached thoughts'? #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-09 21:57:25 have been watching office girls http://sugoideas.com/drama-2011/office-girls/ #[[Chinese]]
  * 2011-10-16 18:31:10 mint.com good for budgeting/tracking money, need same for time (see also: Randy Pausch talk) #[[productivity]]
  * 2011-10-16 18:32:17 some good stuff in Randy Paush productivity talk http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2750363533451832628#docid=-5784740380335567758 #[[productivity]]
  * 2011-10-30 00:19:45 Theory of fun - discusses the purpose of gaming as learning patterns and has some interesting ideas about fun and art #[[books_read]]
  * 2011-10-31 15:35:53 To what extent should we support reprocessing, strengthening existing memory vs gathering new information #[[big_questions]]
  * 2011-10-31 16:01:22 "information foraging" in a wiki vs search (see Blueprint paper) for exploring past memory #[[learnlayer]]
  * 2011-10-31 16:01:45 "enhanced foraging" vs supporting memory #[[learnlayer]]
  * 2011-11-01 14:28:40 Presented to HCII phd students today! Some people seem to think it's hard to use, so I should rethink the presentation #[[Researchr]]
  * 2011-11-01 14:32:37 Also, some suggested that this tool is only really useful as a new PhD student; I considered this too, but I hope I never stop gathering new references and sythesizing ideas! #[[Researchr]]
  * 2011-11-03 13:25:48 When analogy (particularly, [[:perceptual learning|perceptual]] is used with datashop analysis, is there a delay due to processing the analogy? Can that be captured with KCs? #[[analogy]]
  * 2011-11-10 10:40:13 From Scott Hudson's talk: human is relatively fixed, technology changes rapidly => need for HCI #[[hci]]
  * 2011-11-10 10:48:34 more: discovery = finding truth in the low order bits (related to humans or nature (inc. math) but specific technologies move too fast), invention = creating something valuable in the high order bits, connecting opportunities and needs #[[hci]]
  * 2011-11-10 15:41:50 more Scott: inventing is hard because we can't control the variables, we need to account for all of them ideally #[[hci]]
