h3. What is the importance of background knowledge in reading ability? 

Very. Understanding a text generally requires a **situation model**. "The more information they have stored in long-term memory, the more likely they are to be able to develop a situation model, and the better their reading comprehension" ([@willingham2006usefulness]).

h3. Are reading comprehension strategies effective?

[@willingham2006usefulness] concludes:
<blockquote>
  * Teaching children strategies is definitely a good idea. 
  * The evidence is best for strategies that have been most thoroughly studied; the evidence for the less-studied strategies is inconclusive (not negative) and, therefore, there is not evidence that one strategy is superior to another. 
  * Strategies are learned quickly, and continued instruction and practice does not yield further benefits. 
  * Strategy instruction is unlikely to help students before they are in the third or fourth grade.

To me, the difficult orthography of English highlights the importance of careful sequencing in the learning of grapheme-phoneme pairs, along with a limited number of sight words--sequencing that exploits the regularities that exist, and bring children as swiftly as possible to the point that they can read texts and so feel a sense of accomplishment.
