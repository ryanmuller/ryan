<blockquote>Hal Burch conducted an analysis over spring break of 1999 and made an amazing discovery: there are only 16 types of programming contest problems! Furthermore, the top several comprise almost 80% of the problems seen at the IOI. Here they are:

  * Dynamic Programming
  * Greedy
  * Complete Search
  * Flood Fill
  * Shortest Path
  * Recursive Search Techniques
  * Minimum Spanning Tree
  * Knapsack
  * Computational Geometry
  * Network Flow
  * Eulerian Path
  * Two-Dimensional Convex Hull
  * BigNums
  * Heuristic Search
  * Approximate Search
  * Ad Hoc Problems
