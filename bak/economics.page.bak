## Money and wealth

[[http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html|www.paulgraham.com]]:

<blockquote><html>Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, 
clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
and so on.  You can have wealth without
having money.  If you had a magic machine that
could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.
Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.<br><br>Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important
thing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is
a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
they are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,
and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
<i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to 
make money.</html></blockquote>

## Lending and finance

<blockquote>In finance, we have this thing called a bond. A bond is a loan’s business end. When you own a bond, you own someone else’s debt. If this sounds like Slavery Lite, that’s because historically it was. We’re a lot nicer about things now: People who make the loans are expected to assume risk and practice due diligence, because enslaving or imprisoning debtors isn’t as fashionable as it used to be. You can force delinquent debtors to declare bankruptcy and liquidate their assets, but you can’t actually own people anymore. You can only own their bonds, at least in Europe.

A fundamental rule in finance is that you are supposed to get more interest for risky investments. The investor deserves something to compensate for the risk of losing his investment. The guy who needed the money has to pay the investor for the risk he is taking. That’s why loan sharks in the “alternative debt” business demand such high rates of return on their high-risk investments. This isn’t an ad-hoc rule; it is something close to a mathematical law.

If you have some money and want a relatively safe, predictable investment, a bond is a good way to go. Bonds are an old-person investment. Old people don’t generally want to take large risks such as starting a company or investing in stocks; they only want to be paid some interest on their acquired wealth. It’s old-people money that goes into making loans, and it is generally young people to whom the loans are made.</blockquote>
