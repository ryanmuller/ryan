## Tools

A large part of my software use is for [[sources|consuming]], [[collection|collecting]], and [[collaboration|collaborating]] on knowledge. This [[wiki]] plays an increasingly large role in that.

Another part is [[programming]] and talking to other programmers. I like [[vim]], [[git]]/GitHub, and Slack.

The rest is entertainment, which I haven't yet figured out.
