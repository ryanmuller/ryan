Define your factories normally in test/factories.rb or spec/factories.rb:


Factory.define :user do |user|

  user.email                 { Factory.next(:email) }

  user.password              { "password"   }

  user.password_confirmation { "password"   }

end


Factory.define :author, :parent => :user do |author|

  author.after_create { |a| Factory(:article, :author => a) }

end


Factory.define :recruiter, :parent => :user do |recruiter|

  recruiter.is_recruiter { true }

end

Make sure Factory Girl is available in your config/environments/cucumber.rb:


config.gem 'factory_girl', :version => '>= 1.2.3'

Require Factory Girls step definitions in features/support/env.rb:


require 'factory_girl/step_definitions'

Then, write Cucumber features using the simple create record step:


Given a user exists

 or the create record & set one attribute step:


Given an author exists with an email of "author@example.com"

 or the create record & set multiple attributes step:


Given the following recruiter exists:

  | email            | phone number | employer name |

  | bill@example.com | 1234567890   | thoughtbot    | [[http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/284805810/gimme-three-steps|gimme three steps â€” giant robots smashing into other giant robots]]
