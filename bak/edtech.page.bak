You hear these horror stories of teachers staying up all night to do a lesson plan and some soemthing like BetterLesson comes along and helps them save time. Of course they gonna want to adopt something like that. Thats just one example, I think there are hundreds of examples out there.


So by offering that and offering that for free, because again teachers really dont have purchasing power. But they want to save time and everyone moving into the profession are almost by definition tech-savvy, so are fine at going online, downloading something and using that to their benefit. And once there are enough teachers in the school or in the district, the up-sell becomes easier.


And even the superintendents we talked to are being very excited about that because they usually say: I sit and I listen to these sales pitches and try to imagine what the teachers want and then I have to go and convince the teachers to use it and push it down. Superintendants are very excited when a bunch of teachers say: Hey, we are all using this product. Can you buy this additional feature? It actually makes it easier for the superintendent as well.
