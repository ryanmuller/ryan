Stephen Downes wrote up a useful and comprehensive guide for getting the most value from your experience at conferences. Halfway through, he offers a lovely note on nervousness:


One more tip: love your audience. I know that this may sound weird, but it really does work. When you love your audience, when your focus is on how well you can give your gift to them, everything else melts away. Just remember: they are there to hear you (if your a keynote, they actually invited you and paid your way – how could you not love them? How could you have any doubt that they really want to hear what you have to say?


Agreed. Before I go in front of a group, if I remind myself how much I love the work we do and the people we work with, I have a blast. If I focus on performance and the mechanics of public speaking, I'm a wreck.


Also. 1 John 4:18:


There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear. [[http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=12351|dy/dan » Blog Archive » Beating Nervousness In Public Speaking]]

We got explained two models of giving a talk: the clew model and the onion model.

The clew is a logical, linear argument building up to a conclusion at the end of the talk, like a clew unwinding until you finally come to the core. Miss one step in the talk and you lose the plot and miss the point. And yes indeed, this is exactly what happens when I listen to most conference talks and some lectures. In a three days' conference, I actually follow the first five minutes of one or two dozen talks. That is more or less it. After those five minutes, I get lost. I miss a “slide” because I am still thinking about the previous one, get distracted by some random personal associations I had with something the speaker said, or simply doze off because the speaker has a tiring accent.


The onion talk starts with the main message, and adds depth in successive layers around it, always returning to the main message between layers. Since the main message and the main ideas are repeated often, a listener can still follow most of the talk even after dozing off for a minute. Also the talk does not get screwed up near the end when the speaker is running out of time, because by then, the most important things have been said already and the speaker has no reason to hurry.

Good morning. Just a second while I get this connection to work. Do I press this button here? Function-F7? No, that's not right. Hmmm. Maybe I'll have to reboot. Hold on a minute. Um, my name is Abe Lincoln and I'm your president. While we're waiting, I want to thank Judge David Wills, chairman of the committee supervising the dedication of the Gettysburg cemetery. It's great to be here, Dave, and you and the committee are doing a great job. Gee, sometimes this new technology does have glitches, but we couldn't live without it, could we? Oh - is it ready? OK, here we go: [[http://norvig.com/Gettysburg/|The Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation]]

I’ve done one or two talks that I thought were great ideas initially: projects that weren’t finished yet, things that I thought would be interesting to talk about, and so on. They’re talks I regret. Talks should always be reactionary rather than anticipatory: they’re going to come off as more natural, more interesting, and above all, more valuable.


Think about writing a detailed blog post before you speak on any subject. That way you’ll know your comfort level with the information, and, more importantly, you can gauge the reaction of everyone else. Is it interesting? Are you wrong? Does anyone care?
