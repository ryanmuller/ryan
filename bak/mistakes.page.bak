Ive come to believe that mistake making is a critical ingredient to learning, and we do our students a huge disservice when we hold ourselves or others up as experts who just possess perfect knowledge without also showing them the path that was taken to get them there.


And thats why I long for a transformed world where I can pull up Einsteins 9th grade math test, a recording from one John Coltranes earliest performances as a young musician, or a high school English essay from Toni Morrison. I want my students to see that more often than not, many of the successful people they see around them today started just were they areas nervous, directionless adolescents, unsure of whether they had any passions, just trying to make it through the rite of passage we call high school.
