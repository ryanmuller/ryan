## Process

See also [[researchr analytics]]

h3. An overall process

  * Get new input by reading other people's blogs (or wiki RSS if the work is very closely related), going to conferences, and doing research.
  * On wiki: Take notes and summarize -- already works quite well
  * On wiki: Synthesize ideas from notes into keyword-based pages.
  * On blog: Announce and give perspective to interesting observations, new results or technologies, and ongoing conversations. Use blog language to pitch the idea; link to wiki with the gory details.
  * Repeat.

h3. Front page rotation process

Choose a small, fixed number of things to keep on my front page list. Talk about each of these things in my weekly review. Rotate a few out each week. 

## Instructions

These instructions are out of date. It's easier now! Contact me or Stian for help.

h3. Warning

  * You need a Mac. Unless you are adventurous enough to set up something similar on another platform!
  * The setup process is long. But I can help you!

h3. Setup

h4. Download and install the following programs
  * BibDesk, a reference manager http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/
  * Skim, a PDF reader http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/
  * KeyboardMaestro, a keyboard shortcut program http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/
    * The only one that's not free. But you'll be convinced within the time of the free trial.
  * Dokuwiki, a wiki software http://reganmian.net/files/wikiclean.zip
  * The researchr scripts 
    * If you don't want to use Git https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web/zipball/master
    * Or use Git to fork from https://github.com/houshuang/folders2web which will allow you to make changes and get updates

h4. Set up the scripts
  * Extract to some directory
  * Change the settings-dist.rb file as appropriate
  * Customize other hard-coded file locations
    * Path to ''kindle-mount.rb'' within ''kindle-mount.sh'' if you want to import Kindle highlights automatically
    * ''ruby.rb'' -- haven't actually used this myself
    * Path to Desktop within ''skim-tools.rb''
    * Path to your server in ''wiki.sh'' and ''wiki-lite.sh'' if you have one set up (explained below) 

h4. Set up Dokuwiki
  * http://www.dokuwiki.org/install:macosx 
    * Use the wikiclean zip from above instead of the one they link to
  * If you installed to ~/Sites, then enter the following in terminal: ''ln -s /Users/{your Mac login name]}/Sites/wiki /wiki''
    * This will let you access wiki files from ''/wiki'', which is assumed by the researchr scripts by default.

h4. Set up Keyboard Maestro
  * Open keyboard_maestro.kmmacros
  * Change the file locations to point to your ''folders2web'' directory.
  * You may just want to focus on a few at a time as you get used to it--after time, you'll want them all!

h4. Set up Google Scholar for Bibtex import option
  * See bottom of http://scholar.google.com/scholar_preferences

h4. Configure BibDesk
  * Open BibDesk > Preferences (or ⌘,)
    * Under "General", choose a .bib file to save your Bibliography.
    * Under "Fields", set your PDF viewer as Skim.
    * Under "AutoFile", choose a folder to save and rename your PDFs.

h4. Set up a web server for online hosting

h3. Usage

h4. Getting a reference
  * Find it on Google Scholar http://scholar.google.com.
  * Open the PDF and save it to ~/Downloads (usually the default).
    * Researchr will grab the last file saved to ~/Downloads, so you should do one reference at a time.
  * Click the "Import into BibTeX" link.
  * Press ⌃⌥⌘B (that's control+option+command+B) to import the **b**ibtex info.
    * The reference will be imported and highlighted in Bibdesk.
  * Press ⌃⌥⌘L to **l**ink the PDF in Bibdesk.
    * The PDF will be attached to the reference and moved to the location specific in Bibdesk's preferences.
  * Press ⌘E to **e**xport the reference to the wiki. (Optional. The reference page can also be created by exporting from Skim.)

h4. Viewing a reference

  * Open the reference with Skim from either Bibdesk (by double-clicking the attached PDF) or clicking the PDF link in the wiki.
  * Highlight parts of the document that you'd like to save.
  * Take a screenshot by pressing ⇧⌘4 then press ⌃⌥⌘C to **c**ache the image for export.
  * Press ⌘E to **e**xport the highlights, notes, and images to the wiki.

h4. Importing from the web

  * Select text and press ⌃⌥⌘I to **i**mport.
  * Type the name of the page you'd like to add to. If the page doesn't exist, it will be created.

h4. Importing from Kindle

h4. Updating the bibliography on the wiki

This step only needs to happen as often as you want author and keyword pages updated. I usually don't do it unless I specifically need it.
  * In Terminal, move the ''folders2web'' directory
  * Type ''ruby bibtex-batch.rb''

h4. Updating your web server

  * In Terminal, move the ''folders2web'' directory
  * Type ''./wiki.sh''

You may need to enter your password for the server.

h4. Setting access control

Coming soon

## Stuff I've added

  * Automatically generate keyword pages, including a page for notes and the associated kbib page. This way I can easily summarize concepts, which I find ultimately preferable to summarizing papers. See [[https://github.com/cicatriz/folders2web/commit/5bad2988abf7cc3fd12d4e7e9a8369481def1674#bibtex-batch.rb|first]] and [[https://github.com/cicatriz/folders2web/commit/5b8cf714c78014e8b0c5af1a5e907d26350b5272#bibtex-batch.rb|second]] commits.
  * dokuwiki.rb newgist will create a page in the gist/ directory. Here's how I use it:

<blockquote>
I'm reading a big literature review article, which I'm summarizing here: http://learnstream.org/wiki/scientific_thinking (not on the reference page since I plan to reorganize and add more). For each of the interesting references it mentions, I go through the process of getting them into bibdesk, then I ctrl-opt-cmd-G and summarize the article either from what the review says about it or by reading some of it. Then close it and manually type the page include into the scientific_thinking page that is still open. 
</blockquote>

  * dokuwiki.rb log will prompt for a brief message and then create or append to a file in the log directory. The log file will be included in the page of the same name in the root namespace, if one exists. I use ctrl-opt-cmd-L from Chrome. It's very quick to add to a page and kept chronologically, so I feel like it's a better way to collect quick thoughts. See them littered around this wiki for examples.

## Wish list

  * "Keywords that share references with this keyword" to automatically group related concepts
    * Suggest two categories that have too much overlap, suggesting to reduce to one
    * Highly correlated categories that aren't overlaps
    * Suggest categories that seem to be a subset of another
    * Categories frequently matched through another category
    * Random category pairs -- just interesting to see what exists, if anything, at the intersection of two (or more) categories
  * Easy way to pull and resize images from websites (could use ImageMagick on command-line or Applescript in some image editor) and support Delicious-like captions (white text on semi-transparent black background).
