## Methods

  * Skritter!
    * **Currently doing** Remembering Simplified Hanzi
      * First tried writing, definitions, and tones
      * Tones were taking 2x more reviews than everything else
      * Now trying just writing -- no mode switch = super speed?
  * Use Google translate to read my emails in Chinese
    * Then Skritter bookmarklet for adding words?
    * How about an easy way to do MCDs?
    * How could MCDs and the Skritter system interact?
  * Reading long texts with Chinese on one side and English on the other
    * How does this compare to slogging through Chinese only?
  * "Speed" reading with Chinese texts? Try using readfa.st

h3. Phase 2

The options:
  * Input hypothesis: Just track # hours watched. Keep up Skritter, add stuff if you really want it.
    * Engaged vs. background watching?
    * Effort to rewatch things?
  * Aggressive sentence mining: Record-tracking around both SRS practice and card generation
    * Reading or MCD?
    * Video frame also an option, maybe even video clip
  * Video quizzing
    * Comprehension questions nice -- where would they come from??
    * "Which sentence was the one just used?" (How to generate false sentences?)
  * ChinesePod

h3. Video frame flashcards 

I'd like to be able to convert video into flashcards for an SRS. The idea would be to have a sequence of frames and cut out a single character in the subtitles, then on the reverse side have the original frame with the character revealed.

Some partial steps:
  * Use KeepVid (bookmarklet) to grab YouTube as .mp4
  * Use ~/src/vidhl/process.rb to convert into still frames
  * Add Youtube ID to list in index.html
  * Use ~/src/vidhl/index.html to select sequences of frames
  * ...
  * Move frames to ~/Dropbox/acatt_in
  * cmd+opt+ctrl+O to open file in Preview
  * cmd+opt+ctrl+R to resize (no longer needed when combined with vidhl method)
  * cmd+opt+ctrl+C to make copies 
  * Use preview to cut out a character, save
  * ??? to move to acatt_out
  * cmd+opt+ctrl+D to delete the file from acatt_in

Also tried: shortcut for continuous screencapture; unfortunately it doesn't work in fullscreen.
