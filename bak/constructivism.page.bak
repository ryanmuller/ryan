  * Direct instruction: only works for students who are actively trying to learn?
  * Constructive failure: improves DI outcomes according to [@kapur2012designing] (see also [@schwartz2004inventing])
  * What is "prior knowledge activation"? Is that playing a role here? Perhaps [@pressley1992encouraging]
  * Self-assessment - high ability students are better at it. Should we try to improve self-assessment as a skill for low ability students? What will that do?
    * Possible influences:
      * Want to please someone (try convincing student that the response will not be seen or doesn't matter)
      * Not thinking about the extent to which the concept must be understood (e.g. I know what a loop is, but I couldn't figure out how to accomplish some task with a loop.)
      * Comparing against others (try presenting with actual averages, low-balled averages, high-balled averages)
      * Want to succeed, even if in a fake way (try giving points for good prediction)
