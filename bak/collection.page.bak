In general I want to be able to collect something quickly and unambiguously for a variety of media types from different [[sources]]. I'd also like to facilitate reuse, refactoring, and connecting related ideas. The wiki format is good for refactoring and DEVONthink is good for connecting. Reuse is more context-specific (e.g. Evernote for viewing recipes while cooking)

## By media type

**Web articles**: Save to DEVONthink using Web Archive with Instapaper format. DEVONthink's [[http://blog.learnstream.org/2014/06/see-also/|See Also lets me skip tagging]].

**PDFs**: Save to desktop, drag to DEVONthink.

**Entire websites**: I use a variety of scripts and/or httrack to pass URLs to Readability, then save all in a folder in DEVONthink.

**Quotes**: Save to wiki. Bookmarklet for clipping from websites that preserves source URL.

**Videos**: Save to [[to:watch]].

**Books**: Would like to save quotes into wiki, but in practice have rarely done this.

**Recipes**: Save to Evernote. Evernote is good for browsing and viewing from iPad.

**Twitter**: Favorite tweets collected in email by IFTTT. 

**Misc.**: Wolkflowy for quick access to structured text.
