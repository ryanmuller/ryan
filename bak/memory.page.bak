h3. How is memory stored in the brain?

"What does PKMzeta do? The molecule’s crucial trick is that it increases the density of a particular type of sensor called an AMPA receptor on the outside of a neuron. It’s an ion channel, a gateway to the interior of a cell that, when opened, makes it easier for adjacent cells to excite one another. (While neurons are normally shy strangers, struggling to interact, PKMzeta turns them into intimate friends, happy to exchange all sorts of incidental information.) This process requires constant upkeep—every long-term memory is always on the verge of vanishing. As a result, even a brief interruption of PKMzeta activity can dismantle the function of a steadfast circuit.

"If the genetic expression of PKMzeta is amped up—by, say, genetically engineering rats to overproduce the stuff—they become mnemonic freaks, able to convert even the most mundane events into long-term memory."

h3. What is the effect of context on memory's storage and encoding?

See [[memory and context]]

h3. How are memories strengthened?

See [[spacing effect]]

h3. Can memories be erased?

It seems so. "To delete the memory, researchers would administer a drug that blocks PKMzeta and then ask the patient to recall the event again. Because the protein required to reconsolidate the memory will be absent, the memory will cease to exist."

## Mnemonics

h3. What are mnemonics, and how do they work?

The use of visual and spatial memory seems to be able to greatly improve our memory capabilities. "We show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image" [[http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14325.full|Visual long-term memory has a massive storage capacity for object details]]

h3. How can I memorize numbers?

A simple mnemonic technique is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system|Major System]].

A more complex technique is [[http://mnemotechnics.org/wiki/Person-Action-Object_(PAO)_System|person-action-object]], or PAO.

h3. Can rote memory produce the same effects as mnemonics?

(And if so, is it because it creates visual/spatial connections with enough repetition?)

## Memory, learning, and life

h3. What are the advantages of committing things to memory?

"One book, printed in the Heart's own wax / Is worth a thousand in the stacks." - Jan Luyken (quoted from Moonwalking with Einstein, p. 110)

  * Steven Jonas uses SRS to learn facts about a topic to increase his familiarity with it and pique his interest http://vimeo.com/44499957
  * Until recently, people read "intensively" rather than "extensively" -- "a narrow range of traditional literature became deeply impressed on their consciousness".  (from Moonwalking with Einstein, p. 147)
  * Raemon Matthews is a schoolteacher who trains his classes in memory techniques. Students used memorized quotes on AP exams.
  * "Learning, memory, and creativity are the same fundamental process directed with a different focus. The art and science of memory is about developing the capacity to quickly create images that link disparate ideas. Creativity is the ability to form similar connections between disparate images and to create something new and hurl it into the future so it becomes a poem, or a building, or a dance, or a novel. Creativity is, in a sense, future memory." Tony Buzan, as quoted in Moonwalking with Einstein, p. 203.
  * "How we perceive the world and how we act in it are products of how and what we remember. We're all just a bundle of habits shaped by our memories. And to the extent that we control our lives, we do so by gradually altering those habits, which is to say the networks of our memory. No lasting joke, invention, insight, or work of art was ever produced by an external memory. Not yet, at least. Our ability to find humor in the world, to make connections between previously unconnected notions, to create new ideas, to share in a common culture: All these essentially human acts depend on memory." (Moonwalking with Einstein)

This new model of memory isn’t just a theory—neuroscientists actually have a molecular explanation of how and why memories change. In fact, their definition of memory has broadened to encompass not only the cliché cinematic scenes from childhood but also the persisting mental loops of illnesses like PTSD and addiction—and even pain disorders like neuropathy. Unlike most brain research, the field of memory has actually developed simpler explanations. Whenever the brain wants to retain something, it relies on just a handful of chemicals. Even more startling, an equally small family of compounds could turn out to be a universal eraser of history, a pill that we could take whenever we wanted to forget anything.

Multiple papers demonstrated that the act of recall required some kind of protein synthesis—that it was, at the molecular level, nearly identical to the initial creation of a long-term recollection.

Whenever I remember the party, I re-create the memory and alter its map of neural connections. Some details are reinforced—my current hunger makes me focus on the ice cream—while others get erased, like the face of a friend whose name I can no longer conjure. The memory is less like a movie, a permanent emulsion of chemicals on celluloid, and more like a play—subtly different each time it’s performed. In my brain, a network of cells is constantly being reconsolidated, rewritten, remade. That two-letter prefix changes everything.
