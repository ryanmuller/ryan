Internet forum software offers a unique online community experience, which is particularly strong for [[learning]] and [[collaboration]].

**Thread discussion** allows you to see perspectives of others and sometimes get feedback on your own contribution. The comments are preserved in their context so that you can review them at your own pace.

**Stickied threads** are a common forum practice. These threads appear at the top and usually ofter answers to frequently asked questions or more narrative guides to the topic of the forum. These tend to be truly //frequently asked// questions that accumulate from questions that people get tired of answering, as opposed to marketspeak you see everywhere else.

## Comparison to other formats

StackExchange is great for questions with answers thread but not as much for building a small community. A stickied thread could link to a set of SE questions. Perhaps this is not common because forum communities are typically a little more niche so that either those questions aren't answered or the popular answers aren't in line with the perspective of the forum.
