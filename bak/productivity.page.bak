Most of what we do is automatic via [[habits]]. Productivity, then, can generally be thought of as habit formation.

Our behavior is also [[goals|goal-driven]]. 

Willpower may be analogous to a muscle. Limited use, can be improved gradually.

When trying to accomplish something, need four ingredients. Options - what you might be able to do. Process - how to do it. Measure - how to know how well you've done it. Outcome - what might happen when you've done it.

## Tactics/tools

^ Thing ^ Why it might work ^ Tried it? ^ Process ^ Measure ^ Outcome ^
| [[http://emailgame.baydin.com/|Email game]] | Incentivizes fast processing of email | Yes | Go to the site instead of checking email | In-game measure of speed of processing email. Also need to measure time avoided on Gmail. | Perception: very, very good. Expand to other tasks? |
| Timeboxing | Enables focus on a task by setting a limited time in which to expend that focus. | Yes | Open timer using http://e.ggtimer.com | Context-dependent. | Perception: very good, but it needs to be cued. |
| [[http://habitlistapp.com/|Habit List]] | Displays information about current habits. Rewards execution of habit routine by checking off item on list. | Yes | Get app, add habits, check off when completed. | Depends on the habit. | Perception: good. Can be annoying without context specificity. |
| Daily do 5 | Limits number of things to focus on in a day to a reasonable number. Rewards accomplishment of those things. | Yes | Make the list at the beginning of the day. Check limits off when they are done. | Did you make the list? Did you do the things? Are they the right things? | Perception: okay. Currently prefer autopilot schedule. |

| Estimate project finish times | A method for avoiding planning fallacy. Information about when a task "should" be done. | No | Estimate time. Check actual time. Compare. | Time | |
| Track interruptions | 


## Habits

Habits as defined in [@duhigg2012power]. Also includes rituals as in [@loehr2006power], which are basically habits with a specific time as the cue.

^ Habit ^ Rationale ^ Cue ^ Reward ^ Notes ^
| Do dishes before cooking | Dishes need to be cleaned. | I'm about to cook | I have clean things to cook with | Implemented, seems effective |
| Post to HCII mastermind group | People are good support | 4pm Friday | ? | Haven't started at this time. |
| Write 30 minutes to 3 hours per day | Gotta write. | Reminder in calendar. | Pages filling up (visualize this?) | Haaard |
| 15 new characters before bed | Trying to complete 3000 by summer end. Before bed is supposedly a good time. | Snuggled up in bed. | | Daily practice hasn't leveled off. |

I make sure to start every day as a producer, not a consumer.

When you get up, you may start with a good routine like showering and eating, but as soon as you find yourself with some free time you probably get that urge to check Reddit, open that game you were playing, see what you're missing on Facebook, etc.

Put all of this off until "later". Start your first free moments of the day with thoughts of what you really want to do; those long-term things you're working on, or even the basic stuff you need to do today, like cooking, getting ready for exercise, etc.

This keeps you from falling into the needy consumer mindset. That mindset where you find yourself endlessly surfing Reddit, Facebook, etc. trying to fill a void in yourself, trying to find out what you're missing, but never feeling satisfied.

When you've started your day with doing awesome (not necessarily difficult) things for yourself, these distractions start to feel like a waste of time. You check Facebook just to make sure you're not missing anything important directed at you, but scrolling down and reading random stuff in your feed feels like stepping out into the Disneyland parking lot to listen to what's playing on the car radio - a complete waste of time compared to what you're really doing today.

It sounds subtle, but these are the only days where I find myself getting anything done. I either start my day like this and feel normal and productive, or I look up and realize it's early evening, I haven't accomplished anything and I can't bring myself to focus no matter how hard I want to.

I’ve discovered two new sources of stress.

The first is the stress of unmade decisions. The decisions don’t have to be important ones. They tend to be as simple as deciding to go to someone’s birthday party or what to pack for a trip.

My instinct is to analyze the options and put off the decision until the absolute last minute. This is stressful. The consequences of making the “wrong” decision are negligible.

In the case of being invited to go out with someone, I’m usually uncomfortable just saying no.

“Do you want to grab a drink Friday night?”

“Yea I’d love too but let me see what’s on my calendar. I might be busy.”

Then I stress out about responding to the person and know I should go out and be social but I’m not really into it.

It would’ve been much easier to say yes or no right away.

I’m bad at doing this. I rarely respond to Facebook invitations. If I do, it’s probably a “maybe.”

Make inconsequential decisions quickly, don’t analyze it.

The second source of stress comes from shifting priorities.

I recently started working for a big defense company. The pay is decent, there are good perks (company issued iPhone!), and I’m not that invested in the company emotionally. It’s a day job and one of the better ones I’ve had. It allows me to save money while also working on my own project, TrekDek.

Until I started working for the defense company, I was looking for work at a funded start-up. The goal was to learn as much as possible by working at a start-up so I can be in the best possible place to start my own company in a few years.

This past weekend I interviewed with a local start-up for a job that seems pretty cool. I’m excited, but it’s also stressful to think about. It would require me to shift my current priority of saving money and working on my own project to being in start-up mode and putting my own project on the backburner.

Either one would be great, but it’s an uncomfortable and stressful choice to make. I may not have to make the choice as I don’t have a job offer from the start-up, but the process made me realize I should make a decision soon so I can focus.

Decide what your priorities are quickly and follow through.  If you feel compelled to change your priorities, do it quickly. [[http://dalethoughts.com/2012/03/two-sources-of-stress-that-probably-apply-to-you/|Two Sources of Stress that (probably) Apply to You | Dale Thoughts]]

Well, you can do shared notebooks on EN, which I think are viewable to anyone through the standard Evernote web interface. But I thought that realistically very few people are going to be interested in that mess as opposed to more organized writings on my blog. Then the wiki can serve as, well, a wiki, which contains encyclopedia-type entries about stuff I commonly talk about as well as the awesome citation management and article summaries. This kind of loses the open-source mind model, but, to be honest, it's so hard to capture that process entirely and comprehensibly in writing and clips. But I will keep thinking about it.

With the basics out of the way, it’s time to think about what I want from my archives and how to structure things to make it even easier to work. I care the most about the following categories:

Blog posts and notes: I want to be able to review my experiences, decisions, and lessons learned.

Pictures: I want to trigger memories, particularly as I help write family stories. I want to index the pictures by person, so that I can search for combinations of people.

Drawings, sketchnotes, and mindmaps: I want to trigger memories and lessons learned using sketches. I also want to track my progress, which means chronologically ordering my sketches as well.

Book notes: I want to be able to review my book notes by topic and annotate them with questions, actions, and follow-up items. I want to slow down and take more notes while reading books, translating them into ways I can improve my life.

Archives are good for recovering data, but I wonder how I can structure things so that I can use the past to make the future even better.

Some ideas for what usefulness might look like:

A photograph encourages me to write a story, fleshing out the memory more; it might also get me to write that person

A blog post prompts me to revisit an idea and build on it.

A decision review leads to better decisions

Book notes nudge me to follow up on how I’m applying what I’ve learned, and I might reach out to people and tell them about the book

We use Bibble 5 to organize our photos. Bibble has a mode slideshow that can go through more than one slide a second, which is great for rapid review. That might be good for reviewing photographs and drawings to see if any of them trigger a quick memory or feeling. Rotating my desktop background through chosen highlights can also give me a peripheral awareness of faraway family and friends.

For blog posts and decision reviews, my monthly-ish and annual reviews are good for revisiting recent posts. Now that I’ve loaded my archives onto the Kindle, I can also flip through them while waiting.

My scanned mindmaps aren’t as useful for quick recall/addition as I’d hope. This could be because my paper-drawn mindmaps sometimes have text written sideways or upside down (yay for rotating), which is harder to read when I’m flipping through everything in the same orientation. If I stick to writing horizontally and I use bigger, more visual concepts, I can get more of an impression during a quick review. I’ve also used computer-based mindmaps like Freemind. They feel a little different, and I still have to figure out a better way to build mindmapping into my workflow.

Sketchnote-wise, I’ve learned that although OneNote’s infinite scroll of paper is nifty, I like the limits and easy review of a single screen with layers. That’s why I’ve switched to using Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for most of my sketchnotes. They’re much easier to flip through, and I can add them to presentations and yearly reviews easily.

For book notes, slowing down and using a template will help me take better notes from books. It’s not about quantity, it’s about quality. It’s not how much I read, it’s how much I keep (and act on!).

It looks like the key things I can do are:

Export picture highlights and set them as my desktop background. Print them for extra backup/flipping fun.

Import my sketchnotes into Bibble and organize them using keywords. Figure out how to set up a slideshow shortcut to review them. I’ll organize them by year, then use metadata to pull different topics together.

Use Picasa to tag faces in all of my pictures.

Slow down and take more book notes. Translate books into actions. [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/01/thinking-about-reviewing-archives/|Thinking about reviewing archives | sacha chua :: living an awesome life]]

For years I've searched for the one productivity tool to solve all my problems. My to-do list floated from one fancy application to another, even dipping into the command line or pen and paper realms at times. I had fun trying all these things out, but never felt fully satisfied. 

You are a complex human being, with different moods, energy levels, and goals, dealing with streams of data, relationships, etc. How can a to-do list deal with all of that? With this guide, we'll build up a personalized system that works like you do; capability of changing and growing with you. Instead of being centered on the tools, this system will be centered around you and the tools will be interchangeable. 

Some of the problems I hope to help solve:

* You want to develop a new habit or break an old one
* You don't know how to manage all of the different websites you want to read without overemphasizing some and neglecting others
* You often forget to take care of something that you read in an email (or expend too much energy remembering to do those things)
* You want to keep track of all your ideas
* You have struggle to understand the results of attempts to increase productivity
* You notice yourself spending a lot of time where you're unfocused and unengaged: idly browsing Facebook or even staring at your to-do list

We'll mostly be using tools that you probably already know and use, but I'll explain some ways to use them that are often overlooked but make them work much better for you. One of the main things we'll be doing is creating systems that avoid floundering as mentioned in the last bullet point. I enjoy having time that's absent-minded like that, but we'll make sure it only happens in a controlled environment.

Basic idea: Everything needs to be triggered; as little should be left to memory as possible, especially when you've established or you predict an inability to do those things successfully. 







Identifying input flows

(Maybe move this after the three types of tasks)

An input flow is when information from outside you is communicated to you. There are two types of input flows: those where you must (or want to) address each and every item and those that you access when you want to and pay attention only to some parts.

First type: emails, snail mail, IMs, text messages, Facebook messages, TV shows that you like to watch in order, Mint.com alerts
Second type: news sites, forums, TV shows that you watch occasionally, conversations that you initiate, (most importantly) your conscious thoughts

I hope you see that type 1/type 2 has nothing to do with priority: I really don't *need* to watch every episode of Community, but I want to, and I want to watch them all in order, so that is type 1. Meanwhile, I consider it very important to know if there is a major world crisis, but I don't have to read every news story to encounter those, so watching news is type 2. Additionally, things can go different ways for different people. Twitter streams are type 2 for me but may be type 1 for you.

Two strategies for type 1 input flows:

* Reduce the number of streams

To reduce the number of streams, you simply need to redirect them into the same place. The universal standard here is email. Most any web service will allow you to be alerted by email when it needs your attention. You can also find a surprising number of things that will email you whatever you want. 

Example: Hulu can email you whenever a new episode is released (and automatically add it to your queue)

A type 1 subtype is items that you need to deal with immediately. Being on academic timescales, I don't have too much experience with this, but my advice would be to try to separate this from email so that your email checking can be in focused blocks.

* Process each item exactly once and remove it from your attention (a.k.a. "zero inbox")

First, what does it mean to process an item? Basically, it means that this item gets into the right place in your system, so that you can reliably act on it. So the goal of zero inbox is that if you need to act on this email at some point after you read it the first time, you don't want to have to return to your inbox to trigger that action. Any mail program should allow you to remove the item from your inbox but search for it if you ever need the information. The difference is that we're pinpointing a specific message instead of aimlessly browsing around. Browsing is for type 2 things! We will be putting these in a zoo that we can visit and pursue without worrying about those items being out in a wild and screwing up our productivity!

Gotcha: If you really want to use your inbox as a part of the system, then you 

Gotcha: I've had a problem with zero inbox in the past where sometimes I really didn't want to process all of the items, and so I never did it. We'll see how to deal with that kind of problem a little later.

We'll work specifically with type 2 input flows later, but for now the rule is separate type 1 and type 2 flows as much as possible.

Example:

* For some RSS feeds, I like to read every message, while for others there are way too many for me to look at all of them. My strategy was to remove all type 2 from Google Reader and deal with those in another way. Another strategy within Reader is to 
* The same may apply to emails for you. For me, all emails are type 1 and I try to unsubscribe from all non-essential newsletter crap.

Homework:

Make a list of all your input flows and classify them as 1 or 2. How many different type 1 sources do you have to check? Are you ever browsing these sources? Think about how to apply the rules to avoid browsing type 1 items. 

Trigger: If I'm spending a lot of time browsing type 1 items… I should a) make sure there are no type 2 items b) think about about how I can process the items exactly once


Input streams bring the items to your attention. Output streams are the actions you take. We're now going to focus on the cognitive processes and planning that goes on when you translate those items to actions. There are four types of actions you can plan: an action that occurs at a specific time (perhaps repeating), an action that you do occasionally, an action you do once (without a specific time), and one that you don't do at all. Of course, the last is best, but I don't have anything more to say about it here.

Events with specific times

This is easy: if you want to do something at a specific time, put in on your calendar. You need a calendar! Preferably one that reminds you no matter where you are. Google Calendar can send text messages if you don't have a phone with an easy calendar. 

Trigger: If process an item and realize I want to do it a specific time… I should add it to my calendar 

Actually, there is another type in this category: something with a specific _relative_ time. "After waking up…" "After work…" "Before going out to eat…" For these actions, it might not make sense to use the calendar if you aren't doing the other thing at a specific time. 


Things you want to do occasionally

I've tried using a calendar to meticulously plan out every little thing I do in a day. For me, it isn't a sustainable practice. Yet I have a lot of things I would like to do, and I find it really hard to balance them and remember to do all of them. These are my "do occasionally" things: read books, visit websites, explore the city, clean the house.

Generally speaking, all of the sections in this article have a single, well-established solution: email, calendar, to-do list, notes. This category seems extremely important but I haven't seen it addressed before. Lucky for you, I have a tool for it, and it's possibly the simplest of all. 

The system is this: Enter a list of things you occasionally want to do. Whenever you have an unscheduled block of time, go to the site, and it will pull up a random one. That's it! You can do that thing for as long as you want, and if you really don't want to do it, roll again!

That said, I think very carefully about how I arrange my lists. The key with this program is that you can have multiple lists and items of lists that pull up (and shuffle) another list.

1. At this moment my main list is 13 items, each one being something I want to do on the order of once per day and spend somewhere between 10 minutes and a couple hours.
2. Since I have way more than 13 things I actually want to occasionally do, some of these are "hubs" for other things. For example, one of them is browsing websites like Reddit.
3. For each item, it must be exceedingly clear what to do; otherwise, I'm likely to not do anything. So I have items like "read a book", which seems vague, but I usually know which book I'm currently reading so I know exactly what to do and I don't have to change the item every time I switch books. 
4. A good system needs a reinforcing loop. So for things like "read a book", I also have an item that involves finding the next book to read (not something I do daily, so that is part of a hub that includes finding music and other activities as well).
5. Another reinforcing loop is thinking about your list to improve it. So far I have just relied on my own judgement. E.g. if I notice I'm skipping something a lot, I'll think about either making it a more obvious action or removing it.

Another feature that I've added is being able to set a timer. Timeboxing is an excellent way to set your focus, but I've unfortunately been under-utilizing it. In the future I may add an option to force time input, and I may also keep track of timers to allow you to evaluate how much time you've been spending with each item.

Trigger: If I'm frequently ignoring an item in my cycle… I should reconsider how to work with that item (including possibly removing it)

I've developed a habit of relying on Shuff whenever I feel like I'm about to start wasting time; it's a great solution (but only when well-maintained).

Finally: the to-do list

Now you'll see that the to-do list is actually our last resort. Since we've dealt with one-time events, regular blocks of productivity, and new habits, what remains is small tasks that need to be taken care of when is convenient.

When you think you've stumbled into such a task ("buy some milk"), take a moment to evaluate the task

   * Try to take care of it immediately--then you have nothing to worry about. 
   * Try to schedule a specific time for it ("on my way back from work"). If you can do this, don't put it in a to-do list, but somewhere that will definitely trigger at the right time. That can be memory, a calendar event, or some physical reminder (e.g. a note that you'll definitely see). Avoiding memory seems to be easier for me, but people like my mom seem to effortlessly remember everything to do. 
   * See whether this task can actually be part of a habit you want to develop. In our example here, maybe a better solution would be to add "Scan refrigerator for low items and add those to shopping list" as one of your occasional tasks. 
   * When all else fails, the item goes to your to-do list. Make it an actionable item (even if you have to make it "Figure out how to make the following an actionable item")

Trigger: When I realize I need to do a task… see whether I can do it now, schedule it, or habitualize it; if not, add it to a to-do list

----

look for improvements w/ present equipment

1. asking small questions
2. thinking small thoughts
3. taking small actions w/ guaranteed success
4. solving small problems
5. small rewards to self and others
6. recognize small moments

afraid of disappointing a request -> overwhelmed -> failure to do anything & shame

not just make change but make yourself more able to change

acknowledge fear of things

1. ask employee for minor changes; pose questions instead of commands--engages the brain; big questions trigger fear; ask small questions for creativity (e.g. a plane crash - who is in the plane?)

ask once a day big question, once a day small question
* What do I want (small thing)
* What would I be doing different if…
* For self-esteem: one positive thought/act per day. If I were guaranteed not to fail…

So before I hired a trainer, I wanted to see if I could justify the expense by how often I was making it to the gym. That was the 85% Solution. I set a simple goal of going to the gym at least 3 times per week for 1 month, a gradual goal that would take sustained effort.

 

It's important to not set a broad goal, but to be as specific as possible. So my goal was to go on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I kept track of the days I went in a notebook. Now, I didn't stick to this plan 100%. Some days I didn't feel like going, so I didn't. When I didn't go, I tried to go the next day, or an extra time the next week.Sometimes I was inspired to go on a day off, so I went. Other times I missed a day completely.

 

At the end of one month, I had averaged going to the gym 3 times a week -- right on track. So having met the larger challenge of actually going to the gym, I decided to go forward with the trainer.

I was able to convert to this habit during my later years in college (my first two years in college consisted of laziness, video games, girl-chasing, and not so much studying) and when I headed into my professional career.  I don't know if this works for everyone so feel free to ignore my advice or only use parts of it.  Oddly enough, I've never used meditation even though it's been made available to me.


The main idea is to build up a self-image of being someone with a lot of focus over a long period of time by using short-term hacks (like "close all other applications") over time until you have a track record of being someone with a lot of focus and you and everyone else believes you have a lot of focus.  This eventually becomes self-reinforcing because then you begin to naturally do things that stay on track rather than allowing yourself to become distracted.  Like Nietzsche said, "there are no actors, only actions."


So first, don't dismiss hacks like the one you describe above.  Keeping a small bag of these and employing them faithfully will keep you on track and help build the image of having focus.

Develop a habit of getting enough sleep each night.  Sacrifice other activities in order to go to bed on time and manage your daytime schedule so that you can sleep as much as you need.  8 hours is good.  Spend money on a high-quality mattress and very comfortable sheets.  This is a very worthwhile one-time capital investment because you spend 30% of your lifetime here.  Being sleepy makes you easily distracted and makes it more difficult to pay attention to topics for long periods of time (you may start to fall asleep and need to stimulate yourself awake by distracting yourself).

Only work on a couple big things in your life at once.  If you care about a lot of things, decide which 2 or 3 things you really really care about and then start ignoring the rest.  This may involve ignoring certain long-time hobbies or even relationships, though remember that you are making the choices yourself (I mention that so that you don't grieve for the loss of those things, and also remember that you can reverse those decisions).  Exceptional focus does not come without sacrifice.

Exceptional focus does not mean that you are able to work during all your waking hours.  During your "downtime" (time when you are not being productive but also not sleeping), don't try to work on lower-priority projects.  Instead, make sure you are goofing off.  The most focused people maintain focus over long periods of time (months, years) rather than working obsessively on something over entire days (which is likely to lead to burnout), so make sure your daily schedule involves breaks where you deliberately don't do anything productive.  The idea here is to not fatigue your mind with focus, but to continually "re-attract" it back to the thing you want to focus on.

Lastly, orient your thinking towards the notion of completion or goals.  Whenever you are embarking on something, make sure you have a notion of the end goal you are trying to achieve, and drive primarily towards achieving that goal.  Don't worry if the goals aren't exactly right; the idea is to reach them, and if they don't turn out to be exactly what you needed, you can just set new ones.  The reason here is that high focus without goals is just obsession, but if you drive towards specific goals with a lot of focus, you will get things done, which allows you to "let up" on focusing on that goal and refocus on the next one.  The ultimate effect is that you'll become a person who can focus steadily on achieving goal after goal without getting bored or distracted because you know that "soon" you'll reach your next goal and be able to work on the next thing (i.e. it's subverting your "distraction" tendency into being a "drive towards achievement" tendency).  From the outside (and thus, when you look back on your life), it will appear as though you have a lot of focus on one overarching meta-goal that you are able to continually sustain over months and years.  Only you will know that the secret is breaking it up into many little interesting and novel sub-goals! [[http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-improve-my-focus|(20) How can I improve my focus? - Quora]]

Every day, wake up and see what you can experiment with. Foods, lifestyle, exercise, people you associate with and how they make you feel, methods of meditation and self-improvement, methods of feeling contentment when everything seems to falling apart around you. It’s all experiment. Today I woke up extra early, went out by the river in the dark and breathe in while I listened to the laps of the current and the freight trains in the distance. Would my day start off better, more creative, as a result.


Cultivate and nourish the feeling. You are the scientist and explorer of the life around you. Even if it feels fake at first. Really visualize it. You are the scientist. Your life is the laboratory.


Your life and the life of the entire universe. Learn what you can. Study it. Test it. Whenever you find yourself too absorbed in any one result, take a step back. “This is an experiment” say, and wait for the results or try something new. The scientist is happy. You have everything you need in your laboratory. Now go. Be a scientist of life. A lover of the results no matter what they are. And when you find something useful, learn from it and apply it.

How do you explore your limits? I don’t know. I tried to figure out an easy formula for that for this article. But I only know what it’s like for me to explore my limits. I do it by:


-          Questioning everything. Writing if the answers come up different than I thought. (college, home, voting, Europe, war, religion, etc)


-          Writing about everything that made me feel a certain way. Or things I was ashamed of but I learned from. (failure at business, relationships, etc).


-          Not being afraid to contact people “out of my league”.


-          Exploring. Whether its spiritual. Or through reading. Or visiting a new place. Or going further in exercise. Or even trying to do nothing when expectations are to do something.
