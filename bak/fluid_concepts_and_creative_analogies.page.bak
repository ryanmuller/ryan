Douglas Hofstadter and his Fluid Analogies Research Group try to create [[artificial intelligence]] programs that play with microdomains (e.g. sequence patterns, word scrambles) in a way similar to humans. 

The primary design tool seems to be introspection. Given that introspection has been available to us since we've been conscious, what leads them to believe we'll achieve new grounds? [One tactic is to let yourself be surprised by observing the computation in action rather than simply enamored with your own mind.]

The use of microdomains seems necessary for achieving milestones but limiting to the idea that the mind is embodied. 

Their philosophical basis captures aspects of [[perception]], [[representation]], [[analogy]], and [[concepts]] that are very likely to be essential to the mind. Quoted in full (p. 84):

<blockquote>
  - the //inseparability of perception and high-level cognition//, leading to the idea of a perceptual architecture being at the heart of cognition;
  - the fruits of high-level perception being //easily reconfigurable multi-level cognitive representations// held loosely together by bonds of different types and different strengths;
  - the idea of //subcognitive pressures//--namely, that the more "important" a concept or representation is, the greater an influence it should be allowed to exert, in a probabilistic sense, on the direction of the processing;
  - the //commingling of many pressures//, both context-dependent and context-independent, leading to a nondeterministic parallel architecture in which bottom-up and top-down processing co-exist gracefully;
  - the //simultaneous feeling-out of many potential pathways// at differential rates governed by quickly-made estimates of degree of promise;
  - //the centrality of the making of analogies and variations on a theme// in high-level cognition;
  - the possession, by cognitive representations, of //deeper and shallower aspects//, with the former remaining relatively immune to contextual pressures, and the latter being more likely to yield under pressure (to "slip");
  - the crucial role played by //the inner structure of concepts and conceptual neighborhoods// in all these goals, particularly context-dependent conceptual overlap and proximity, and context-independent conceptual depth.
</blockquote>

The philosophy may be summarized as "cognition equals recognition", in contrast with "reasoning is reckoning" (p. 131). [Ties closely with something from, I think, //The Science of the Artificial//.
