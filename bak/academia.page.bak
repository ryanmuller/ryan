It is the paper you must buy; the paper you must publish; the paper you must cite; the paper on which not just citations but tenure, reputation, status, and even school rankings are built.

Gerry Altmann, editor of Cognition, an Elsevier journal, and an open-minded man, doubts this sort of post-publication filter can serve the purpose. “Peer review should be about ensuring that there’s a robust fit between findings and conclusions, and that a paper sits well within the context of a discipline,” Altmann told me. “These are insidious changes.” [[http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/free-science-one-paper-at-a-time-2/all/|Free Science, One Paper at a Time | Wired Science | Wired.com]]

Forum of Mathematics, Pi and Forum of Mathematics, Sigma are an exciting new development in journal publishing. Together they offer fully open access publication combined with peer-review standards set by an international editorial board of the highest calibre, and all backed by Cambridge University Press and our commitment to quality. Strong research papers from all parts of pure mathematics and related areas will be welcomed. All published papers will be free online to readers in perpetuity. A publication charge for authors will be set at a rate justified by real publishing costs, and for the first three years Cambridge University Press will underwrite the publication costs.

All submitted articles will be peer-reviewed and will benefit from the full functionality associated with reputable journal publishing: copyediting, typesetting, reference linking, usage statistics, etc. The decision whether to accept articles will be made solely by the Editors in complete independence from Cambridge University Press.


The author will hold the copyright of published papers. [[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displaySpecialPage?pageId=3896|Cambridge Journals Online - Forum of Mathematics, Pi and Forum of Mathematics, Sigma FAQs]]
