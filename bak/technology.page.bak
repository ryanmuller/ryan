Big question: How has culture and industry reshaped in light of digitalization, and what will happen to education?

At an industry level:
  * Shopping - An explosion of online retailers, now largely dominated by Amazon. Amazon also serves as a platform for other retailers.
  * Music - A few major service types and service providers that provide access to digital music. 
  * News - An explosion of online bloggers. Some emergence of a few aggregators such as HuffPost or Gawker. News corporations still reshaping.
  * Knowledge - An annihilation of the encyclopedia industry in favor of a free, crowdsourced provider. Personalized assistance provided by StackOverflow and others. This is replacing what?
  * Communication - Email, BBS/forums, instant message, social networking service. 
  * **Education - ??**

New industries:
  * Search
  * Social sharing

At a personal level (see also [[individualism]]):

Stuff about me
  * Stylistically: Initially a surge of personalized MySpace pages and similar. Now limited to a "cover" on facebook.
  * Professionally: my linked in, my digital portfolio, my Github account
  * My friends (Facebook)
  * My interests (Pinterest, Facebook likes)
  * My health data (see [[personal informatics]])
  * My pictures (several)
  * Where I've been/what I've done (Foursquare, Facebook Timeline)
  * Game achievements via XBox Live, etc
  * What I've donated to (Kickstarter)
  * **What I've learned ??**

Do I reflect on this stuff? Timehop, Amazon Daily Review, ...

Stuff I receive
  * Incredible ability to personalize news and entertainment media. 
  * Social filter via Facebook feed, G+, social search with Bing
  * Shopping - several choices, lots of metadata
  * **Lectures? Learning opportunities?**

Stuff I produce/how I work
  * Many ways to share, but lots of competition: Youtube, Tumblr, Github depending on your preferred medium.
  * New freelancing opportunities
  * Curation: Pinterest, Youtube playlist, Pandora station, ??

At a cultural group level:

Geographically distributed groups formed around niches.

The result will be a world population with a large majority of people on the edge of madness, somehow functioning in a haze where past, present and future form a chaotic soup (have you checked out your Facebook feed lately) of drunken perspective shifts.


This is already starting to happen. Instead of a newspaper feeding us daily doses of a shared Field, we get a nauseating mix of news from forgotten classmates, slogan-placards about issues trivial and grave, revisionist histories coming at us via a million political voices, the future as a patchwork quilt of incoherent glimpses, all mixed in with pictures of cats doing improbable things.

In Western cultures, nature is a cosmological, primal ordering force and a terrestrial condition that exists in the absence of human beings. Both meanings are freely implied in everyday conversation. We distinguish ourselves from the natural world by manipulating our environment through technology. In What Technology Wants, Kevin Kelly proposes that technology behaves as a form of meta-nature, which has greater potential for cultural change than the evolutionary powers of the organic world alone.

The apparent science fictional nature of ecological-scale projects has prompted science fiction author Karl Schroeder to observe that the large-scale harnessing of ecologies might explain our current lack of success in encountering advanced alien civilizations. Schroeder explains the Fermi Paradox – the apparent contradiction between the likelihood that extraterrestrial civilizations exist and the lack of evidence for them – by speculating that we have not yet encountered our cosmic neighbors because they are indistinguishable from their native ecology.

In the 1990's, less than 1 percent of relationships started through personal ads or online intermediaries. By 2005, 37 percent of Internet users had at least one relationship with someone they met online. Today, 20 percent of all relationships start online.

This is a tremendously important distinction between Slow Web and Fast Web. Fast Web is destination-based. Slow Web is interaction-based. Fast Web is built around homepages, inboxes, and dashboards. Slow Web is built around timely notifications. Fast Web companies often try to rack up pageviews, since pageviews mean ad impressions. Slow Web companies tend to put effectiveness first. Here’s the crazy thing about Budge: the better it works, the less I use it. Once I get in the habit of flossing, my brain takes over, and I no longer need the notifications. Walter describes this credo well in the aforementioned blog post:


Behavior change, not growth. Behavior change is about improving the lives of others, scale is about ego. Getting scale after nailing behavior change is easier than nailing behavior change (and thus having a shot at durability) after hitting scale.


It doesn’t mean Slow Web companies can’t grow. It simply means that they put effectiveness before growth. And effectiveness leads to a sense of gratitude—I may be done flossing with Budge, but there are other things I could improve, and having been through it once, I trust the company even more.

<blockquote><html>Jumping into the boundless streams of Twitter is not very different from compulsively buying books in the false hope that, one day, you might read them. Of course, you won’t, but this doesn’t matter: it’s the very brief encounter with that possibility that counts. The fire hose of social media tricks us into thinking that, for a fleeting moment, we can play God and conquer every link that is dumped upon us; it gives us the mad utopian hope that, with proper training, we can emerge victorious in the war on information overload. Likewise, the possibility of controlled disconnection—embedded in software like Freedom and hardware like my safe—reassures us that our task lists and deadlines are manageable, if we approach them systematically and without distraction. Like travel and dance, both are illusions concocted by modernity, but this shouldn’t prevent us from enjoying them in full.</html></blockquote>
