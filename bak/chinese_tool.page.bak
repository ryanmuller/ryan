## Description

h3. Text

Main process
  * Pull up a website - something stored or something shared
  * Timer counts down
  * Mine some sentences for MCD. More sentences = more points
  * When timer expires or "Next" button pressed, moves on to the next page

Bonus 
  * Pages automatically shared based on # of sentences that people mine from them.
  * Ability to specify sequencing of pages. I.e. show page n before page n+1 (perhaps just specify how to extract ordinal number from URL)
  * Guess readability of pages based on user model
  * Pinterest-esque capturing and display, or just straight into SRS?
  * Auto-generated simple quizzes from text?

h3. Video

One option: something like Duolingo but for transcribing video. Transcribed video can then be given the Text treatment (maybe even add some screenshots for comic book style)

Tools:
  * http://www.universalsubtitles.org/
  * [[http://mozillapopcorn.org/popcorn-maker/|Popcorn Maker | Mozilla Popcorn]]

Getting screenshots will probably be very hard unless video is downloaded. Could use multiple embedded videos set to different frames, but this gets computationally intensive.

I'm reading Moonwalking with Einstein ( http://amzn.com/0143120530 ), which is convincing me of the power of good mnemonics. 


For Skritter, I think that means having really strong images for common components. For instance, I decided to use Chuck Norris for the 人 radical. In the section of RSH2 that introduces 人, I was able to blast through those mnemonics at probably double the speed and made far more memorable ones. 


I propose a project where we come up with some strong images for as many components as we can. Each component may have a few suggestions that people can use in case someone is lacking the cultural reference. 


What makes a strong image? We can discuss in this thread, but I'd say that it's a very specific PERSON or SETTING with many colorful characteristics (beard, cowboy hat, karate outfit). It also helps to have a certain style associated with it: Chunk Norris mnemonics can all just be ways that he is being awesome. 


Why do this instead of just sharing mnemonics on Skritter as usual? I see two problems: 

a) someone made a great mnemonic, but you don't want to use it because suddenly 人 is Chuck Norris.

b) someone hasn't made a great mnemonic for the word you're studying, and there's no way of seeing what people may have done with the components. [[http://www.skritter.com/forum/post|Skritter | New Topic]]
