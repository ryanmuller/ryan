Much of science instruction is borne of the hypothetico-deductive tradition, whereby a hypothesis is generated, tested, and revised, beginning the cycle again. However, the sequential presentation of experiments and results may lead students to miss the underlying causal structures that run across several cases. An inductive method, where students are asked to explain several contrasting cases presented together, could be more effective. Two studies compare hypothetico-deductive and inductive methods of instruction, in the context of an interactive physics simulation. The second study examines the critical ingredients of this inductive method of instruction. The work has implications for the design of simulation-based instruction. 


Catherine Chase is an incoming post-doc in the Department of Psychology at CMU. Her research centers around the design and evaluation of instructional methods that scaffold math and science learning. She will present a study investigating students' learning of physics from contrasting cases [[http://learnlab.org/calendar/phpEventCalendar/eventdisplay.php?id=1362|LearnLab Calendar: Event Display]]

  * Predict Observe Explain (POE) used to challenge misconceptions
  * Inductive generalization (IG) used to induce structure from several examples, based on [[analogy]] research

Problem with POE: where does the new explanation come from?

IG seems to cut down on surface-based explanations

Induction is criticized by complex systems literature because the rules won't work across multiple levels

Extensions:
  * Can IG be applied to performing novel experiments (or even just chooses which case to investigate next)?
  * See whether IG is itself a skill that can be improved or vary among students
