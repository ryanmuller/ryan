Peter Thiel claims that we are done accelerating. http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/278758/end-future-peter-thiel

There's also been a slew of articles on Hacker News about software in particular: "I hate almost all software" https://plus.google.com/115094562986465477143/posts/Di6RwCNKCrf "the state of the art is terrible" http://zackarymorris.tumblr.com/post/10973087527/the-state-of-the-art-is-terrible

(In contrast, there is The Lights in the Tunnel, which ALSO claims the economy is screwed but for the opposite reason: *too much* technological progress. http://singularityhub.com/2009/12/15/martin-ford-asks-will-automation-lead-to-economic-collapse/)

What are threats to progress?
  * America's education sucks
  * The Smart People are all thinking about advertising/finance/cat pictures (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8)
  * Businesses only do stuff that makes money
  * Science doesn't tackle the right problems or otherwise doesn't work very well
  * We need another Manhattan project or Apollo program (mis-directed government resources)
  * Government taxes and regulations / patent laws / other reasons are not allowing new businesses to flourish
  * Google is making us stupid
  * The tools suck
  * Quality of food decline

We need rapid growth to meet the wishful expectations of our retirement plans and our runaway welfare states. We need science and technology to dig us out of our deep economic and financial hole, even though most of us cannot separate science from superstition or technology from magic.

Who can speak about the true health of the ever-expanding universe of human knowledge, given how complex, esoteric, and specialized the many scientific and technological fields have become? When any given field takes half a lifetime of study to master, who can compare and contrast and properly weight the rate of progress in nanotechnology and cryptography and superstring theory and 610 other disciplines?

Consider the most literal instance of non-acceleration: We are no longer moving faster. [[http://www.instapaper.com/text?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalreview.com%2Farticles%2F278758%2Fend-future-peter-thiel|The End of the Future - Peter Thiel]]

The monetary system is crutch, as is the pharmaceutically-centered medical industry. The quality of food is declining, which has a direct effect on cognition. Aspartame and MSG, laden in junk foods, are excitotoxins. Moreover, the US media cultivates a paradigm of ignorance, distraction, and desensitization. US imperialism continues to divert resources toward killing Middle Eastern civilians. These glitches all retard what we would think of as progress. 


The internet has expanded the human capacity for knowledge acquisition and long-distance communication. It is like a thousand libraries of Alexandria, accessible to (eventually) anyone. The potential for scientific advancement is immense, and we are seeing it everywhere. A problem is that the status quo suppresses the truly groundbreaking revelations. This is changing, the power structure is in contempt, as evidenced by the massive, global civil unrest.


I would disagree with Thiel. While an excellent commentary, "progress" does not move linearly. Kuhn described a dynamic of punctuated equilibrium, defined by periodic paradigm shifts. Economically, the Western markets are in state of melancholy, suspended animation, and, as of today, have an elevated probability of catastrophic failure. This is Schumpeter's process of creative destruction at work: before a new, more efficient system can arise, the rotten core must be discarded and rebuilt anew.
