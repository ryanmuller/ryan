h3. What is the rationale for the "worked example effect"?

Some learning researchers claim that worked examples are the best form of learning: they present knowledge in a way that is compatible with [[:cognitive load]] limitations of the brain. The worked example effect is a response to the belief that more practice is the key to skill acquisition when evidence mounted that problem solving was not always ideal ([@atkinson2000learning]).

h3. When is a worked example inadequate for learning?

According to [@chi1989self], when there is a "lack of specification of the explicit conditions under which the actions should be executed."  

h3. What studies have confirmed or disconfirmed worked example effect?

{{skim:mclaren2008and0.png}} (from [@mclaren2008and])

  * [@paas1994variability]
  * [@ringenberg2006scaffolding]: worked examples more efficient than tutor
  * [@schwonke2007can]
  * "we found that worked examples alternating with isomorphic tutored problems did not produce more learning gains than tutored problems alone" ([@mclaren2008and])
  * [@schwonke2009worked]: worked examples more efficient than tutor

h3. When does the worked examples not apply? How can this be addressed?

[@kalyuga2003expertise] penned the **expertise reversal effect**, where high scaffolding becomes detrimental to advanced learners because it requires them to break down knowledge they've already developed to conform to the instructional material. Other research has explored **faded examples**, where full examples are presented to a beginning learner and eventually steps are faded such that the learner must complete them.

h3. How should multiple worked examples be presented?

Discussed in [@atkinson2000learning]

   * Interleaved topics ([@paas1994variability])
   * Interleaved with problems ("only one such study" according to [@koedinger2008better])

h3. Worked examples in broader themes

  * [@sweller2010teaching]
