## Things to track
  * Skritter progress
    * More time spent with TV should be better for Chinese in general, but won't necessarily show in Skritter progress -- not sure if there's better ways to track this
  * Healthy/cooked meals
  * How to quantify research progress? Papers read (and summarized?)? Number of ideas? Lines of code? (Obviously, paper submitted/accepted and/or citations for longer term.)
  * Whether house/workspace is acceptably clean
  * Not books/pages read but interesting things acquired from them (what about participation in discussions -- (potentially) benefit for others?)
  * # of songs/shows/games/activities //enjoyed//? 
    * How to represent? 
    * How to remember to record?
  * Shuff/researchr/etc coding and process-refining??
  * Weightlifting
    * in pound*lifts?
## Notes

Observation: only really care about *increasing* time if the thing is inherently enjoyable. Instead, increase output goals and time will probably need to increase to make them happen. Shouldn't need to worry about decreasing time either, if everything else is functioning. So... combine the above goals with time to optimize for efficiency? Or instead of time? Time better as time or points?

So feedback loops work. Why? Why does putting our own data in front of us somehow compel us to act? In part, its that feedback taps into something core to the human experience, even to our biological origins. Like any organism, humans are self-regulating creatures, with a multitude of systems working to achieve homeostasis. Evolution itself, after all, is a feedback loop, albeit one so elongated as to be imperceptible by an individual. Feedback loops are how we learn, whether we call it trial and error or course correction. In so many areas of life, we succeed when we have some sense of where we stand and some evaluation of our progress. Indeed, we tend to crave this sort of information; its something we viscerally want to know, good or bad. As Stanfords Bandura put it, People are proactive, aspiring organisms.
