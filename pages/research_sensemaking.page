## Research questions

h3. Paper-centric

  * What are the cognitive processes that people undergo when making sense of an academic paper?
    * Hypothesis: It varies based on their prior knowledge/expertise ([@chi1981categorization]).
  * What are the physical artifacts that can be made by individuals in the process or aftermath of making sense of an academic paper?
    * Hypothesis: Influenced by the environment in which they access the paper.
  * How can other people use physical artifacts made by others to more effectively or efficiently make sense of an academic paper?
    * Hypothesis: links to other sources are important (Ruogu's previous work)
      * Why and under what conditions would this be true?
        * Analogical comparison - comparing two results or two methods or two concepts to get at their underlying abstraction
        * Evaluate background for an assumption in this paper
        * Evaluate effect of taking this paper as assumption in further work
        * Simply a better explanation of a concept in this paper
    * Hypothesis: ways to categorize are important ([@fisher2012distributed])
    * Hypothesis: expert schema may be incomprehensible to novice
  * How can these artifacts be used to improve the paper (i.e. a generalization of the peer review & revision system)?

## Meeting notes

h3. June 12, 2012

Possibilites:
  * Sensemaking within one paper 
    * domain experts vs not
  * Sensemaking for a group of papers
    * cross-referencing
    * answering specific question
    * summarizing a topic

Can we get data directly from online community?

Mathoverflow, physics, theoretical CS, statistical analysis 

h3. May 29, 2012

  * A reasonable goal: can we improve the time it takes to make sense of a paper by using the work of other people?
  * A stretch goal: revolutionize the publishing industry

What are the goals of someone reading an academic paper? Does this fit with the sensemaking loop? ([@card2005science])

Two artifacts: highlights and takeaway points

Cognitive artifacts: schema, chunks 

  * Are they independent? Do they both add value?
  * Evaluating the quality of participants' work
    * Get experts opinions (experts in the field, authors of the paper)

h3. Meeting with Niki

  * sharing at the chunk level
  * how to link together
    * A and B are related
  * not enough time for paper sharing
  * look at how people take and integrate chunks from a single paper
  * indicate interest within a paper and generate other interesting things
  * start at the citation granularity -- maybe pull apart sections "intro", "data", etc. PLoS for open and parseable stuff?
  * opportunities for pilot
    * interesting papers from CHI
    * lab meeting
    * course

Once your paper was up, anybody who wanted to would be able to respond to it. Posting a response would be a bit like posting an answer to a question on Mathoverflow, and as with Mathoverflow it would be possible to make comments, either on the paper itself or on people’s responses to it. Also as with Mathoverflow, it would be possible to vote up people’s responses, which would give them reputation points.


What would be in a typical response? It could be anything useful: obvious possibilities would be a description of the main results for the non-expert, an evaluation of the paper, an explanation of what the paper contributes to its area, an assessment of how big that “area” is, a list of minor errors, and so on. [How might we get to a new model of mathematical publishing? « Gowers's Weblog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/how-might-we-get-to-a-new-model-of-mathematical-publishing/)

Most of the time, what makes one feel that an important result is “truly established” is, these days, not the fact that it eventually appears in a good journal, but the fact that it is read and understood by people in the field, who are likely to be able to sense if there is something fishy about the proof. If the result is sufficiently interesting, then that tends to happen long before the paper comes out.


With an online system of the kind I’m talking about, one could have more transparency about this process. Someone could write a response saying, “I haven’t checked this line by line, but the paper is based on a very nice idea, which I basically understand, and it’s quite clear that the details can be made to work.” [How might we get to a new model of mathematical publishing? « Gowers's Weblog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/how-might-we-get-to-a-new-model-of-mathematical-publishing/)
----
Why do we need this measure? One of the main reasons is that we find ourselves having to judge other mathematicians, notably when hiring them. We get their CVs and publication lists, and we have a look through the latter to see what kinds of journals they are getting their papers published in. But if they are lucky and get an indifferent paper accepted by a very good journal, it will be very difficult for anyone but an expert to know this — and the unfortunate fact is that we often have to judge people who work in areas we don’t know much about. We also have only a rather vague idea of the relative quality of many journals. The one document that could really help us, the referee’s report, is strictly private.

Somebody gets the website up and running, and people start submitting their papers to it, as well as submitting them for publication in the normal way. Then if the new method works in the way I think it should, it will gradually be realized that the extra information one gets from the fact that a paper has been accepted in a journal is close to zero, and the journal system will wither away. If it doesn’t work, then it’s the site that withers away: it goes down in history as yet another online initiative that failed to take off. [How might we get to a new model of mathematical publishing? « Gowers's Weblog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/how-might-we-get-to-a-new-model-of-mathematical-publishing/)

I forgot to mention one other aspect of an online system that would in my opinion be a huge advantage. It’s that there are many kinds of mathematical communication that do not get published in journals because they are “the wrong kind of thing”. For example, if you write an essay about why certain promising approaches to a problem don’t in fact work, then unless you can express it precisely in the form of a mathematical theorem (a famous example of this is Razborov and Rudich’s Natural Proofs paper), then you won’t get it published. Similarly, if you rewrite an existing proof in a much clearer way, you won’t get that published either, even if what you’ve done is far more useful to other mathematicians than yet another obscure theorem. On this site, you could submit mathematical documents of all kinds, perhaps giving them labels such as “new result” or “exposition of existing result” or “discussion of open problem”. If these were good enough, you would get glowing responses to them. Perhaps this could lead to a cultural shift towards giving more value to mathematical activities other than proving theorems.

Mathoverflow reputation points work because we know that they’re just a game. If they actually mattered, then abuses of the system and all manner of unpleasantness would be much more likely. [A more modest proposal « Gowers's Weblog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/a-more-modest-proposal/)

A useful aspect of the current system is that journals fix an official version of an article, which can then be the one that other articles refer to. [A more modest proposal « Gowers's Weblog](http://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/a-more-modest-proposal/)

That’s where www.howsmypreprint.com comes in. (The suggestion for a name is of course not serious.) You put your preprint on the arXiv and you create a page on Howsmypreprint, wait a little while, and then a few weeks later (or perhaps much sooner if the system really works) you get a list of typos, small errors, big errors if there are any, suggestions for how to improve the presentation, and so on.


But why is anybody ready to do that for you? Here’s where a suggestion of Andrew Stacey comes in: if you want your paper checked over in this way, then you have to pay for that service by doing it for other people. In other words, you accrue points for working on other people’s papers, and you spend them when they do work on yours.
