The goal is to create an interactive video-based learning environment from best-known practices and compare it with other conditions. Video is not often combined with effective cognitive tutors, yet it is very popular, distributable, and seems to be engaging.

## Background

Motivation: an increasing availability and popularity of high-quality lecture video material (MIT, Khan Academy). Not much is understood about how learners actually use the video or the learning outcomes for much of this material. 

Interactive online courses have had promising results, as in [@lovett2008open], and the use of online materials is ever-increasing. 

h3. Multimedia and interactivity

  * Interactivity has been shown to the effectiveness of videos ([@goldberg2000student], [@zhang2006instructional])
  * {{page>gist:wouters2007interactivity}}
  * {{page>gist:moreno2007interactive}}
  * {{page>gist:mayer2003nine}}
  * [@clark2010analysis] claim that multimedia does not benefit learning

h3. Representation of knowledge

What is actually shown in the video will make a big difference, so we should be concerned with how knowledge is [represented](representation). 

  * Use KLI to break into [[knowledge components]] ([@koedinger2011knowledge])
  * [[Conceptual knowledge]] vs. [[procedural knowledge]] ([@rittle1999conceptual])
  * [[Grounded representation]] shown to be better when presented before formal representation ([@braithwaite2011effects])
  * Facilitate [[analogy]] ([@gentner2009reviving]); concrete or abstract? ([@reeves1994role], [@goldstone2005transfer])
  * [@melis2004towards] talk about representation for math knowledge

h3. Knowledge presentation

Do we want videos of conceptual information or worked examples or...?

  * [[Worked examples]] are effective; [[faded examples]] a further improvement ([@melis2004towards])
  * {{page>gist:ringenberg2006scaffolding}}
  * {{page>gist:chi2008observing}}

h3. Practice

I'd like to tie the videos with practice and problem exercises.

  * Interleaving worked examples with problems is effective
  * [[Testing effect]] shows that just having practice questions is good ([@roediger2006test])
  * [[Spacing effect]] - when to schedule practice; also when to repeat video segments?
  * Spacing effect not as strong for complex material?

## Implementation


h3. Domains

  * Carnegie Learning/University of Phoenix
  * Vincent's mathtutor: https://mathtutor.web.cmu.edu/
  * Physics supplemental help at Mudd
  * Khan Academy
  * OLI (statistics or Paul Steif) 

h3. Ideas

  * Provide videos for students along with their homework problems
  * Faded examples using video as a scaffolding 
  * Are students able to find their way around the video or is breaking up the video into pieces worthwhile (for faded examples or whatever)? 
  * Use spacing effect to review video segments

## Experiment

First, want to code videos to see exactly what is being taught. Perhaps develop a student model of interactivity if there is data from students interacting with video. 

Possible ideas:

  * Video vs. no-video (also need to look at what the video is covering. Conceptual? Procedural?) 
  * Massed vs spaced and blocked vs interleaved practice
  * Student using feedback (e.g. tracking progress on components)
  * Testing effect, pre-questions and post-questions

## Notes and clips

h3. Ken meeting 9/19

<blockquote>
There is a discussion in the KLI paper about how the testing effect and worked example effect are at odds ... also about how wide spacing and comparison may be at odds ...

The testing effect could be used to justify an "all-practice" condition -- just the cognitive tutor -- vs. a mixed one vs. all video.
