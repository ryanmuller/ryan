How good are people at selecting their own learning strategy? Related to [[motivation]]. [Bibliography](kbib:metacognition).

//How Children Fail// is the most lucid treatment of metacognition that I've read. Unlike surveys or experimental settings, Holt observes children in the real world. He finds that children often select negative strategies in educational settings.

Learners are poor at judging their own comprehension.

## Research questions

For "extreme learners":

  * If it were up to you, what would your learning be graded on?
  * What process would you use to enumerate what you've learned?
  * Why are you learning X?
  * What is your "rhythm" for learning (e.g. same amount of new stuff every day, binging, etc.)

<blockquote><html>Rereading is a terribly ineffective strategy. The best strategy--by far--is to self-test--which is the 9th most popular strategy out of 11 in this study.&nbsp; Self-testing leads to better memory even compared to concept mapping (Karpicke &amp; Blunt, 2011). </html></blockquote>

<blockquote><html><strong>What people who don't write don't understand</strong> is that they think you make up the line consciously â€” but you don't. It proceeds from your unconscious. So it's the same surprise to you when it emerges as it is to the audience when the comic says it. I don't think of the joke and then say it. I say it and then realize what I've said. And I laugh at it, because I'm hearing it for the first time myself.</html></blockquote>
