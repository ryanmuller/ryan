In History of the Corporation, Venketash Rao argues that we are entering an era where we reach peak attention -- corporations are unable to mine any more productivity from us, and a new kind of market emerges, one for new perspectives. And this world is ruled by individualistic lifestyle designers.

He offers a vision in [Welcome to the Future Nauseous](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/05/09/welcome-to-the-future-nauseous/)

<blockquote>The result will be a world population with a large majority of people on the edge of madness, somehow functioning in a haze where past, present and future form a chaotic soup (have you checked out your Facebook feed lately) of drunken perspective shifts.

This is already starting to happen. Instead of a newspaper feeding us daily doses of a shared Field, we get a nauseating mix of news from forgotten classmates, slogan-placards about issues trivial and grave, revisionist histories coming at us via a million political voices, the future as a patchwork quilt of incoherent glimpses, all mixed in with pictures of cats doing improbable things.</blockquote> 

According to Stuart Card, ongoing individualistic movements exemplified by Maker Faire, Quantified Self, and Instructables are just natural steps in a technological cycle. In the past, we've seen the same with amateur rocketry and the Homebrew computer club. The technologies in these movements will fall into a "dominant design", and presumably be corporatized as part of that process. 

However, perhaps corresponding with the peak attention phenomenon, there are some ways that we may be entering a new kind of individualism. The digitization of everything means we can access nearly fully customized information. With the data of QS, we may be able to understand our own health to the point of being able to avoid manipulation from corporations. Through web tools like Khan Academy, we could have fully individualized education. There's even a conceivable solution for energy: we all get sunlight (sorry Norway -- you're doing well enough anyway).  

A major issue in all of this is having the intelligence to use it. This is already a clear problem with accessing digital content. Major corporations still pull the strings in terms of what is distributed. We still get ads. It isn't too hard to imagine the same problem with QS: outside influences tell you how to interpret the data. Although one difference is that it is at least you know it's coming directly from the source -- but, more sinisterly, unwanted forces could even get into the sensors. And let's not even think about the manipulation that could happen with educational material. 

Regardless, institutions will resist. See: legibility, NSA.

Reality, you might say, as failed state; its interior collapsing into permanent conflict under the convergent pressures of deviant globalisation, its coasts predated upon by new mutant forms of memetic pirates.


Each individual also carries reality-divisions inside their own head:


As a general point, there is a fundamental dissassociation endemic to industrialised humans that results in some deleterious, and, at this critical juncture, very dangerous outcomes. We necessarily develop many internal veils and compartments in order to buffer the fundamental ethical, environmental and cognitive dissonances industrialised existence presents us with.


The clearest example, though, and perhaps the major reality-distinction in most people’s minds, is between their immediate, everyday life and the magic fantasy world that exists in the media-realm.

Thrun also demonstrated Glass on Charlie Rose and it’s worth watching the first five minutes there just to see (a) exactly how weird the glasses look, and (b) exactly how wonderful the interaction seems. This isn’t about sharing pictures. This is about sharing your vision.


Now, Google’s big pitch video for Glass is all about utility, with just a dollop of delight at the end, but don’t let that fool you. There is serious delight waiting here. Imagine actors and athletes doing what they do today on Twitter—sharing their adventures from a first-person POV—except doing it with Glass.

Allen Carr advises smokers who are considering quitting to put the following three questions to themselves, and I think we can also ponder them as we consider whether it is worthwhile to try to be cured of our addiction to people. As the smoker considers smoking, we ask of socializing:


  i. What is it doing for me?

 ii. Do I actually enjoy it?

iii. Do I really need to go through life paying through the nose, just to stick these things in my mouth and suffocate myself? [Why Go Out? | Brick Magazine](http://www.brickmag.com/why-go-out-heti)
