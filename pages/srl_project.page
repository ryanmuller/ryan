## Background

What are the tasks that learners are doing when they might use the system? What are their cultural approaches?
  * [@nicol2006formative]
  * [@ringberg2007cultural], [@lee2009designing] - Understand users' cultures in relationship with service
  * [@kornell2009learners] - Believe self-testing is not that helpful for learning but use it to diagnose ability

What are good strategies that should be used by students?
  * [@roediger2006test] - Self-testing
  * [@pintrich2004conceptual]

When should we teach the strategies vs. afford them by the interface?

Reasons to believe we should intervene on self-regulated learning:
  * [@mitrovic2001investigating], [@long2011students] - Even with data, students don't self-assess or aren't able to connect the data to the learning process
  * [@azevedo2008externally] - Externally regulated performed much better

Examples of interventions:
  * [@azevedo2008externally] - Human tutor promoting good strategies
  * [@pavlik2008using1] - automatic scheduling of material
  * Look at Kornell
  * [@arroyo2007repairing] - present progress in-between problems

What are the concerns related to assessment?
  * See [@nicol2006formative], [@yorke2003formative]
  * Children's reaction to assessment - Dweck
  * Dependence on assessment - Boud, Bandura
  * Better for students to have a "conversation" about what is expected of them. [@yorke2003formative]

## Model

{{pages:srl_project02.png}}

http://prezi.com/scp5rxnk1r-b/model-for-studying/

h3. Tasks
**What tasks are people attempting to do when they use a particular system**

  * Approaching a totally new domain
  * Studying for a test
  * Improving skills and knowledge more generally
  * Attempting to complete an external assignment
  * Maintaining proficiency
    * This seems less common -- what are attitudes towards it?

h3. Attitudes and habits

  * How do users feel about system-driven decisions?
    * Ex: reminders to study, evaluation of knowledge level
  * What kind of role does the software play for the user? Teacher, peer, extension of self? 
  * Conjecture: should not design system as an additional authority figure that dictates grades and ranks students, but also don't want to go too far with user choice -- the user should be able to overcome obstacles
  * What do users expect from the system?

h3. Transitions
**How people move between states of the model**

  * Assessment drives many transitions at the //system// level
  * At any time, user can transition out of the system

h3. Time
  * short term (how long to continue on an item?)
  * long term (how long to continue learning? when to visit?)

h3. Systems

  * Learning in forums (Art of Problem Solving) or QA sites (Stack/Math Overflow)
    * What are the implications of not having any of the support features (e.g. perhaps just browse and view presentation)
  * Alcumus
  * more community-based (LiveMocha)

h3. Constructing knowledge and re-representation

h3. Strategy

Strategies and actions (from [@azevedo2008externally])
{{skim:azevedo2008externally1.png}}

h3. Infrastructure

  * //Student models// are used by system to help user **assess progress**, **choose items** (tells students what they need), **practice** (choosing items at the right difficulty for the student), **get feedback**, **get assistance** (feedback/assistance can be targeted to the student's weaknesses)
  * //Assessments// are used to make transitions in the graph and inform student models
    * Self-assessments can be used as well
    * Informed by KLI?
    * Different types of assessment
      * Porfolio (e.g. web design)

h3. User-driven vs. system-driven aspects

  * Beging studying
    * initiated by student or reminded by system (e.g. Nudge, KUI)?
  * Strategize/select action
    * goals set by student or provided by system?
    * time estimations provided by system?
    * select cognitive learning/thinking strategies? (what are these?)
    * provide motivational rewards?
  * Assess progress
    * comparisons between problems or from concept to problem?
  * Browse items
    * items suggested by system?
    * other ways of organizing?
  * Practice
    * items suggested by system?


They may be more subtle system-driven or system-influenced aspects aligning to SRL. E.g. how a task is perceived, to what extent the student is goal-oriented, etc. See [@pintrich2004conceptual]

## Research questions

  * Are students able to use web resources in an effective way? 
    * e.g. [@atkinson2007interactive] - they should be engaging with worked examples (but probably aren't)
    * Do students assemble the right resources for their learning goals?
  * What are attitudes towards learning in these environemnts? (see [@kornell2007promise])
    * Which attitudes are important? (correlates with procrastination [@wolters2003understanding], correlates with motivation [@pintrich1990motivational])
    * Do students take a mastery approach or use long-term planning?
    * How do students react to failure ([@dweck1988social], Derek's data seems to show students reacting favorably)
    * Do students use learning strategies, and how are these strategies affected by feedback from the system?
    * How do students approach self-testing ([@kornell2009learners])
  * How can students be assisted in using resources better?
    * Turadg - remind students //when// to study, assist students in //how// to study by prompting for explanations in worked examples
    * Ari Bader-Natal - using social features to scaffold motivation, assistance, etc.
    * Yanjin - Open Learner Models for reflection
    * Ruogu - how to share information with peers
    * How can student models be used to adapt the service to students?
      * How can assessments (perhaps including self-assessments) be used? 
    * Better resources: ITS, high quality videos, etc.
  * Can the system affect behaviors beyond?
