Gary Kasparov:
<blockquote>Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</blockquote>

Examples:
  * chess
  * typing faster than handwriting
  * poker, using tracker and stove

Inspires:
  * easier ways to use machine learning
  * teach people how to interpret numeric results (like using many numbers in pokertracker as constraints and directions for gameplay)
