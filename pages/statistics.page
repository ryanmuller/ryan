<blockquote>Every time there is a suicide at MIT, there are calls from numerous parts of the community for action by the Administration. If suicides are in fact a random
process then such calls are unwarranted as a consequence of a particular suicide
or suicides (although in the long run, it still might be worth taking action to
reduce the overall rate).</blockquote>

<blockquote><html>  Statisticians from Francis Galton and Ronald Fisher onward have used statistics to give us a much deeper understanding of human and biological variation.  I can’t see how any non-statistical, mechanistic model of the world could reproduce that level of understanding.  Forget about p-values, Bayesian inference, and the rest:  here I’m simply talking about the nature of correlation and variation.</html></blockquote>
