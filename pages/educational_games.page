Within a couple hours, most kids playing DragonBox will be able to start solving simple algebraic equations, and what’s more, they’ll be having fun and they may not even know they’re learning algebra at first. Also surprising is that they don’t even need to know basic arithmetic to play the game. I showed DragonBox to my five-year-old and she loved it, and didn’t even want me to play ahead because she wanted to be the one to unlock all the levels.
