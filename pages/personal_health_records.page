AutismTrack is a portable, customizable data tracking tool that empowers caregivers of those with autism to easily track interventions, behaviors and symptoms. Checkboxes allow daily recording of any therapy, medicine or diet. Simple "sliders" allow rating of any behavior or symptom (e.g., eye contact, aggression and echolalic speech).

h3. Charm

Finally, what parents need. A way to track treatments for autism. With a few easy key strokes, I enter basic treatment info once and daily observations, and then ChARM converts it into information that I can use. ChARM now helps me take care of my child.

h3. Bodytrack

The BodyTrack project seeks to help people working to track down suspected environment/health interactions (food sensitivities, asthma or migraine triggers, sleep problems, etc.). In many cases, simple medical tests to identify sensitivities and triggers do not yet exist, leaving people to try to discover through a trial-and-error approach involving cycles of hypothesis generation, modification of inputs, introspection, and evaluation. Keeping track of everything that's potentially important is a real challenge, and we believe that better tools for collecting and exploring relevant data and observations will help.
