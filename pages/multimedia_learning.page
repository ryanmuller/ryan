There is plenty of precedent for prematurely predicting the death of the textbook.


“Looking at paradigms for educational change for the next century, I can safely predict the death of the textbook…They are repositories of information and they occasionally provide impetus to explore a subject in more depth. These functions can be performed much more easily by CD-ROMs.” David D. Thornberg in "Edutrends 2010" (1991)


"...single textbooks are yielding to overheads, micro-film readers, tapes, dial-access systems, and a complex of mechanical devices aimed at helping the learner to paddle his own canoe" Kajubi (1975) cited in Robin Barrow, "Radical Education" (1978)


"Books...will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be completely changed inside of ten years." Thomas Edison, in The New York Dramatic Mirror (1913) [Electronic textbooks: What's the rush? -   Daniel Willingham](http://www.danielwillingham.com/1/post/2012/04/no-title.html)
