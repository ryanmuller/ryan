[[a:K Anders Ericsson]] has done much work on expertise. deGroot found that the only difference between tournament players and top expert chess players was their chunking of board arrangements (source?). 

h3. What is different about being an expert?

Expertise with skills increases automaticity. “It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copybooks and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” - Alfred North Whitehead, as quoted in [@willingham2009don].

h3. How does one become an expert?

Many hours of deliberate [[practice]]. “The best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks.” - H.H. Read, as quoted in [@willingham2009don].

Giant improvements in athletic records in many sports is evidence that we have found better ways of training for expertise (since genetic changes could not possibly occur that quickly). (From K. Anders Ericsson, as described in Moonwalking with Einstein, p. 174) There may also be psychological barriers around certain records, such as the four minute mile.

h3. How can I break through a plateau?

For a speed-based skill, such as typing, set a metronome and try to do the thing every time it clicks. Figure out your limits and set it to be 10 to 20 percent faster. Work at that speed until you stop making mistakes. (from Moonwalking with Einstein, p. 172-3)

## Educational implications

"How can we expect to train the next generation of scientists if we are not training them to do what scientists actually do? But a flawed assumption underlies the logic, namely that students are cognitively capable of doing what scientists or historians do. [...] Real scientists are experts.They have worked at science for forty hours (likely many more) each week for years. It turns out that those years of practice make a qualitative, not quantitative, difference in the way they think compared to how a well-informed amateur thinks. Thinking like a historian, a scientist, or a mathematician turns out to be a very tall order indeed." ([@willingham2009don])

As a young man, Rogoff was a world-class chess player. He eventually translated his ability to grad school where he studied economics with a focus, naturally enough, on game theory. What caught my attention in Rogoff’s interview was his dedication to diligence.


Even two interests, in Rogoff’s thinking, represented one too many:


[A]t graduate school he became convinced that dividing his attention meant that both his chess and his economics were suffering. He had to make a decision. [He chose economics.] “Part of my strategy of moving on was to give it up completely. I don’t play chess casually…Not unless it’s incredibly rude to decline playing.”


He elaborates:


“Being very good at anything involves being somewhat addicted.”


Bottom line: I am increasingly stricken by the yawning gap that exists between the feel-good, follow your passion, be the change you want to see-style chatter that fills the online world, and the reality of how people actually end up making a true impact.

There are many causes of plateaus but a major one seems to be routine. Sticking in the same habits, whether it’s writing, programming, design or business often results in failing to progress, despite investing a lot of time.

I think the paradox of mastery shows the inevitability of some form of tension if you want to excel at something. Persistent, intolerable stress is probably bad. But alternatively, staying comfortable in your routine is not best either. [Are Habits the Enemy of Mastery? « Scott H Young](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/03/25/habits-and-mastery/)

Project-Based Learning 


The idea behind project-based learning is that you design a project which will force you to push your skills into new areas. I've used this extensively to teach myself programming languages, French, calculus and even cooking.

 

The first step is to decide what skill you want to improve. Many people fail to take this step, simply hoping for better results in some area of life without first determining the skill which corresponds with success.

 

The next step is to pick a dimension of that skill you want to improve. This is equally critical. You can't simply become a "better writer" since being a better writer involves so many sub-skills, from crafting good headlines to telling stories and using research. Unless you pick a dimension, you'll be stuck in a plateau forever.

 

Now you design a project which will force you to emphasize that dimension of the skill. [Learn Faster: The Art of Rapid Skill-Building - cognitionmachine@gmail.com - Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1363687e4e2e5d95)

If you didn't see my last post(s) on www.conceptart.org then I will bring you up to speed. Basically I have been inspired by the art produced and the work ethic of Jon Foster, Andrew Jones, Jason Manley, and my brother "Smeagol71" (among many others) and have decided to learn how to paint (primarily digitally). I am starting from rock bottom and I am going to paint at least one painting and do at least one sketch every day...probably two on the weekends. The order you see them in is the order that I am painting and/or sketching them...every day starting on 9/15/02. I am bearing my soul to everyone. I will post everything I do...whether it is awful or not. Most of the paintings and sketches, in the beginning, are going to look like crap but hopefully over the days/weeks/months/years they will start to get better. I have no formal art training but have signed up for classes this semester. I have a passion to paint and welcome any encouragement or critique that you want to give. Any feedback you want to give me you can leave in the threads I or just email me.

WHAT IS THE DAN PLAN?


Its a project in transformation. An experiment in potential and possibilities. Through 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, Dan, who currently has minimal golf experience, plans on becoming a professional golfer. But the plan isnt really about golf: through this process, Dan hopes to prove to himself and others that its never too late to start a new pursuit in life [The Dan Plan - deliberate practice](http://thedanplan.com/theplan.php)

According to distinguished journalist Geoff Colvin, both the hard work and natural talent camps are wrong. What really makes the difference is a highly specific kind of effort-"deliberate practice"-that few of us pursue when we're practicing golf or piano or stockpicking. Based on scientific research, Talent is Overrated shares the secrets of extraordinary performance and shows how to apply these principles. It features the stories of people who achieved world-class greatness through deliberate practice-including Benjamin Franklin, comedian Chris Rock, football star Jerry Rice, and top CEOs Jeffrey Immelt and Steven Ballmer.

Journalist Coyle travels the world to discover the truth about talent in this fascinating account that studies how individuals can unlock their full potential and bring their talents to light. The discoveries put forth by Coyle come down to three main elements: coaching, motivation and practice. While these hardly seem like breakthroughs, Coyle's discovery process proves fascinating. Providing detailed examples from a variety of different sources, Coyle's work becomes as motivational as the stories he presents. John Farrell reads with a voice that is at once firm yet highly identifiable. The resulting recording serves as a fine instructional guide for those searching for how to fulfill their dreams.

Well, I do have a method and its really a series of questions more than anything else. Its almost a Socratic process but I would say that, first and foremost, I have to have a very clear, measurable objective, whether thats in language acquisition or in power lifting.


The common element is measurement, so you need to know when you have succeeded and how to measure progress to that success point, whether thats a 500 pound dead lift or a 50 kilometer ultra marathon or getting to the point where you can do, lets say, a single lap in an Olympic pool with 15 or fewer strokes.

Secondly, I will look at the most common approaches, which are, oftentimes, the lowest common denominator but have some thread of efficacy. I will ask, What if I did the opposite? Ill look at the established common practices, the established dogma, and ask myself what if I did the opposite.


If its endurance training, lets look at Iron Man training, and the average is 20-30 hours of training per week for people in the upper quartile. What if I limited that to five or fewer hours per week? What would I have to do? How could I make this type of training work, or perhaps be more effective, if I had to focus on low volume instead of high volume? The same could be said of weight training. The same could be said of language learning.

Thirdly, I look for anomalies. For any given skill, theres going to be an archetype of someone should be successful at that skill. If its swimming, for example, it would be someone with the build of Michael Phelps. They would have a long wingspan, relatively tall, big hands, big feet and large lung capacity. So, if I can find someone who defies those anatomical proportions  say, someone whos 5? 5?, extremely heavily muscled, like 250, who is still an effective swimmer  I want to study what the anomalies practice because attributes can compensate for poor training. I want to find someone who lacks the attributes that can allow them to compensate for poor training.


Typically, you find much more refined approaches when you look at the anomalies.  [How to Use Philosophy as a Personal Operating System: From Seneca to Musashi](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/05/18/philosophy-as-a-personal-operating-system-from-seneca-to-musashi/)

According to my colleagues, this star researcher tends to begin with techniques, not problems. He first masters a technique that seems promising (and when I say “master,” I mean it — he really goes deep in building his understanding). He then uses this new technique to seek out problems that were once hard but now yield easily. He’s restless in this quest, often mastering several new techniques each year.

The challenge was sneaking the CREB in.

Fitts and Posner (1967) [3] suggested that the learning process is sequential and that we move through specific phases as we learn. There are three stages to learning a new skill:


Cognitive phase - Identification and development of the component parts of the skill - involves formation of a mental picture of the skill

Associative phase - Linking the component parts into a smooth action - involves practicing the skill and using feedback to perfect the skill

Autonomous phase - Developing the learned skill so that it becomes automatic - involves little or no conscious thought or attention whilst performing the skill - not all performers reach this stage

The leaning of physical skills requires the relevant movements to be assembled, component by component, using feedback to shape and polish them into a smooth action. Rehearsal of the skill must be done regularly and correctly. [Skill Development](http://www.brianmac.co.uk/tech.htm)
