<blockquote>The claustrum is a thin, irregular, sheet-like neuronal structure hidden beneath the inner surface of
the neocortex in the general region of the insula. Its function is enigmatic. Its anatomy is quite
remarkable in that it receives input from almost all regions of cortex and projects back to almost all
regions of cortex. We here briefly summarize what is known about the claustrum, speculate on its
possible relationship to the processes that give rise to integrated conscious percepts, propose
mechanisms that enable information to travel widely within the claustrum and discuss experiments to
address these questions</blockquote>
