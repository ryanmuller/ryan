## Introduction

"To become a successful self-regulated learner, as defined by [@zimmerman1990self], people must develop or be taught how to monitor and self-assess their learning status, then use the results from self-assessment to reasonably allocate learning resources to the different content they are learning, as well as select appropriate learning strategies" ([@muller2012personal]).

Where does SRL apply? Ken: there seems to be a bias toward studying simple declarative knowledge in the most popular models. In other bodies of work, Ericsson writes about expert skill acquisition (e.g. [@ericsson1994expert]). Schoenfeld writes about metacognition and motivation for complex problem solving in math (e.g. [@schoenfeld1987cognitive]).

Cognitive strategy use

  * 30. When I study for a test, I try to put together the information from class and from the book 
  * 31. When I do homework, I try to remember what the teacher said in class so I can answer the questions correctly 
  * 33. It is hard for me to decide what the main ideas are in what I read (*R)
  * 35. When I study I put important ideas into my own words 
  * 36. I always try to understand what the teacher is saying even if it doesn’t make sense. 
  * 38. When I study for a test I try to remember as many facts as I can
  * 39. When studying, I copy my notes over to help me remember material 
  * 42. When I study for a test I practice saying the important facts over and over to myself
  * 44. I use what I have learned from old homework assignments and the textbook to do new assignments 
  * 47. When I am studying a topic, I try to make everything fit together 
  * 53. When I read materials for this class, I say the words over and over to myself to help me remember 
  * 54. I outline the chapters in my book to help me study 
  * 56. When reading I try to connect the things I am reading about with what I already know.

Self-regulation

  * 32. I ask myself questions to make sure I know the material I have been studying 
  * 34. When work is hard I either give up or study only the easy parts (*R)
  * 40. I work on practice exercises and answer end of chapter questions even when I don’t have to 
  * 41. Even when study materials are dull and uninteresting, I keep working until I finish 
  * 43. Before I begin studying I think about the things I will need to do to learn 
  * 45. I often find that I have been reading for class but don’t know what it is all about. (*R)
  * 46. I find that when the teacher is talking I think of other things and don’t really listen to what is being said (*R)
  * 52. When I’m reading I stop once in a while and go over what I have read 
  * 55. I work hard to get a good grade even when I don’t like a class

h3. Motivational strategies 

Strategies identified by a survey of college students ([@wolters1998self]). Are these actually effective??

## SRL training and interventions

  * [@dignath2008can] - meta-analysis of SRL training programs for primary school; moderate effect sizes across many types of programs
  * Azevedo - SRL for learning from hypermedia
    * [@azevedo2004does] - training SRL strategies
    * [@azevedo2008externally] - externally facilitating SRL strategies (with a human agent)
  * [@zimmerman2011enhancing] - SRL training intervention at urban technical college
