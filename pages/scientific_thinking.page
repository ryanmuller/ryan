[@zimmerman2007development] provides an review of many studies in developmental scientific thinking. Some of these are summarized below.

**Studies that observe skills**:

^ Citation  ^ Skill  ^ Age  ^ Observation   |
| [@siegler1975acquisition] | record keeping | 5th & 8th grade | 5th graders do not keep records when needed |
| [@tschirgi1980sensible] | confounded variables | child-adult | held variables constant when they produced positive outcomes |
| [@kuhn1989children] | theory vs evidence | child-adult | increases but theory and evidence conflated even in adults
| [@sodian1991young] | theory vs evidence | 1st & 2nd grade | most can distinguish between a hypothetical belief and evidence to recognize conclusive experiment |
| [@ruffman1993reflecting] | belief change | 4-7 years old | can use covariation evidence to change hypothesis in simple tasks |
| [@amsel1996development] | belief change | child-adult | don't change belief from evidence when they have prior beliefs |
| [@koslowski1996theory] | belief change | 6th grade to adult | implausible covariant evidence didn't lead to belief change unless explained |
| [@fay1996knowing] | indeterminacy | preschool | different strategies; "positive capture" strategy gives errors |
| [@shaklee1988covariation] | covariation judgement | | strategies improve over time, but conditional probability strategy (the best one) is not developed |
| [@gopnik2001causal] | causal reasoning | 2-4 years old | use covariation as evidence for causality |
| [@masnick2003error] | experimental error | 2nd & 4th grade | can propose and recognize sources of error |
| [@cook2011science] | confounded variables | preschool | can strategically isolate variables |

**Studies that compare instructional interventions**:

^ Citation  ^ Skill  ^ Age  ^ Conditions ^ Result   |
| [@siegler1975acquisition] | manipulating variables | 5th & 8th graders | conceptual framework with and without analog problems | analog problems were much more effective | 
| [@kuhn2005developing] | manipulating variables | 6th grade (low-performing) | with and without prompt to investigate single variable | made more inferences (immediate, transfer, and delay) when prompted to investigate a single variable |
| [@chen1999all] | confounded variables | 7-10 years old | probes with and without direct instruction | direct instruction is better and transfers |
| [@klahr2004equivalence] | confounded variables | 3rd & 4th grade | direct instruction, discovery learning | direct instruction is better and transfers |
| [@dean2007direct] | confounded variables | 3rd & 4th grade | direct instruction, practice, DI+PR | PR, DI+PR better after 10 weeks of usage; PR better after 6 week delay |
| [@schulz2009double] | exploration | preschool | instruction, accidental discovery, no instruction | instruction decreases the range of possibilities that are explored |


General observations: Prior belief greatly impedes learning new concepts. People try to achieve a positive outcome (see also [[mindset]]).

Most of the research in my lab is concerned with the question of how we carve up the world into meaningful clusters and reason about those clusters. This question leads to research projects on categorization, intuitive theories, conceptual change, words and concepts, and causal understanding with a special emphasis on how patterns vary across conceptual domains.
