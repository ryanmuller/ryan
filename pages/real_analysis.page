What can be done with the real analysis material?

## Video dictionary 

  * Look up definitions, example, etc. with text & video. 
  * Something like Blueprint ([@brandt2010example]) for solving math problems? 
  * Research question: Is this better for learning than traditional lecture format?

## Video interaction/ITS

  * Prediction while watching a worked example
  * Fill-in-the-blank for definitions and theorems
  * True/false conceptual questions
  * Structuring for common proof types 
    * Can we have automated feedback in proof steps? Need an expressive input that is more formal but quicker than proof-writing (could show a rough translation into words to encourage transfer)
    * Probably can't get a general solution -- think about nice representations for particular families of problems
  * How to deal with conceptual change? 
    * Examples in material:
      * Rationals and nat numbers are same cardinality
      * Real numbers and rationals are different cardinalities, though reals can be constructed from rationals
