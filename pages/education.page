Arum and Roksa conclude:


“gains in critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing skills (i.e., general collegiate skills) are either exceedingly small or empirically non-existent for a large proportion of students”;

36 percent of students experienced no significant improvement in learning (as measured by the CLA) over four years of schooling;

less than one-half of seniors had completed  over 20 pages of writing for a course in the prior semester;

total time spent  in academic pursuits is 16 percent; students are academically engaged, typically, well under 30 hours per week;

scholarship from earlier decades suggest there has been a sharp decline in both academic work effort and learning;

“students…majoring in traditional liberal-arts fields…demonstrated significantly higher gains in critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing skills over time than students in other fields of study. Students majoring in business, education, social work , and communications had the lowest measurable gains”;

35 percent of the students sampled spent five hours or less a week studying alone; the average for all students was under 9 hours. [Academically Adrift: A Must-Read - Innovations - The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/academically-adrift-a-must-read/28423)
