And the way you do that, Earl, is by taking them downtown to plays, museums, concerts, lectures, where they can learn the moral life of downtown.” [II.

There is a paradox. As children, most of us think we are highly creative; as adults many of us think we are not. What changes as children grow up? Organizations across the globe are competing in a world that is changing faster than ever. They say they need people who can think creatively, who are flexible and quick to adapt. Too often they say they can't find them. Why not? In this provocative and inspiring book, Ken Robinson addresses three vital questions:

Why is it essential to promote creativity? Business leaders, politicians and educators emphasize the vital importance of promoting creativity andinnovation. Why does this matter so much?

What is the problem? Why do so many people think they're not creative? Young children are buzzing with ideas. What happens as we grow up and go through school to make us think we arenot creative?

What can be done about it? What is creativity? What can companies, schools and organizations do to develop creativity and innovation in a deliberate and systematic way?

This year’s primary sponsor is BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, whose CTO spoke at yesterday’s glitzy opening ceremony featuring the Waterloo Warriors cheerleading squad. Other sponsors include Lenovo, IBM, Amazon.com, and Google. It’s understandable that so many tech companies would want to nurture IOI: Google is famously built atop an algorithm called PageRank; Twitter’s “Who to Follow” feature is a set of algorithms; Amazon’s entire site, from sales rank to product recommendations, is a system of interlocking algorithms.
