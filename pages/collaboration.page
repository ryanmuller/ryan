<blockquote><html>“Ninety percent of the information people have is still in their heads and not on the web,” says <a href="http://www.quora.com/Charlie-Cheever" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Charlie-Cheever_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">Charlie Cheever</a>, one of Quora’s cofounders. According to Cheever, Quora’s goal is to capture as much of that subjective knowledge as possible. “There’s no place where you can put all this wisdom you accumulate over your life or these things that you just know,” he says. “And that just seems such a valuable piece of what people have to share. It seemed a shame not to have someplace to share that.” Quora’s other founder, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Adam-DAngelo" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Adam-DAngelo_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">Adam D’Angelo</a>, Facebook’s first CTO, calls it “experiential knowledge.” Unlike with Wikipedia, whose searchable trove has been built on the backs of tireless amateur researchers, Quora hopes to attract so many users that their inherent knowledge will construct a comprehensive picture of the world.</html></blockquote>

<blockquote><html>The large expanse between the two approaches—the purely objective and the purely subjective—is the terrain that Quora hopes to occupy. What was it like to live in Silicon Valley in 1998? What goes on neurologically when a song lodges inside a person’s head? What should the Winklevoss twins have done to protect their idea for Facebook? Will human consciousness ever be transferable to a computer? Those are questions no encyclopedia could ever hope to answer fully, and yet in each case, there are people who can tackle them with a fair bit of authority. For years, blogs have occupied this territory, but their idiosyncratic and diaristic style has left their insights largely inhospitable to search. By creating an environment for members to post and answer questions, as well as rate the quality of others’ answers, Quora is building a searchable repository of information while it also builds a community.</html></blockquote>

<blockquote><html><p>The central idea of a wiki — whether it’s driving Wikipedia or C2 — is that anyone can add or edit a page, but those pages all live on servers that someone else owns and controls. Cunningham now believes that no one should have that sort of central control, so he has built something called <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">the federated wiki</a>.</p>

<blockquote><html>The mission of my research is to <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:20px">fortify</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:20px">apply</span> the cognitive science of innovation. My overall strategy is to do basic cognitive research and develop new tools and platforms for innovation. I believe fundamental basic research can inform and test ideas for new tools and platforms, which can in turn yield new questions and insights for basic research.</html></blockquote>
