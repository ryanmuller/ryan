I tend to get addicted to endless streams, so I try to limit sources to be completable in a reasonable amount of time. I use StayFocusd to limit time on sites that prohibit this (Imgur, Quora, need to use with Twitter...)

**Books**: Still the best. Immediately try to get Kindle sample for books that look interesting.

**RSS**: Read with Feedly. Ideally average a half hour of reading per day by keeping sources highest quality and most relevant.

**Twitter**: Necessary evil to follow a huge range of people.

**Tumblr**: Some great stuff on here but hard to find and filter.

**Courses**: Despite the MOOC-mania, a prime example of a good course is [CIS194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/): a set of //text//-based lecture notes and assignments with excellent pedagogy.

**Google Scholar alerts**: Trying this out to stay on top of research from favorite authors.
