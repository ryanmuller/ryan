Observations about drawing, comics, art, etc.

Understanding comics
  * spectrum from reality to meaning

Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain
  * left brain, right brain differences
  * "Confidence" - subtitle of DotRSotB, also theme in talk of Elizabeth Gerber w/r/t design
  * "The painter draws with his eyes, not with his hands...no more muscular agility than it takes for him to write his name."  (noticed that it also requires patience -- but the patience too comes naturally from the flow of the experience)
