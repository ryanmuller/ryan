## To Do
  * Transform online data to student model priors
  * Choose student model algorithm
  * Calculate item utility
  * build sequencer options
    * Highest utility
    * Performance ranges
    * other
  * Investigate student classifier

## Comparing Different Sequences:
  * Streak - everything right at least once, 3 in a row to complete level
  * ITS - If you miss, comes again after a space of 1
  * Try Again - must get each item correct
  * Random - try everything once
  * Student Model Based Adaptive Algorithm

## Interleaving pretest and post test
  * Play items from prior levels (repetition allows for measuring student learning)
  * Play items from future levels (early introduction allows for testing model assumptions)

## Sequencing Structure
  * Introductory stage (easy)
  * Pretest stage (difficult; optimize model learning)
  * Training/pretest/posttest stage (range)
