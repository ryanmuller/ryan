Bad generalizations: people like to make them (or they're just going for click-bait). I think the gut reaction to a generalization is that they feel like nerd-progress -- either by conquering the frightening realm of the specific and many, killing many birds with one stone! or they are battling the common errors of lesser minds with the weapon of plain and simple truth. The problem is that most of these generalizations are incorrect, and therefore aren't immediately useful in either sense. Understanding the [virtue of narrowness](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ic/the_virtue_of_narrowness/) may help curb the bias towards generalization.

Example: "Generalizations are bad" <- Bad. "Incorrect generalizations are bad." <- Better.

"Ideas are worthless"
  * Example offender: https://plus.google.com/110581693083408452344/posts/cMCwLee5Wn9
  * Why it's wrong: Einstein, Darwin, third example.
  * When it's true: Even an ill-formed idea can ignite a fire in the right conditions. But worthless ideas, especially when you don't know things (see: "You don't need to read"), are worthless.
  * How to fix it: Science!

"You don't need to read"
  * Example offender: http://bennesvig.com/2011/12/05/youve-probably-read-enough/
  * Why it's wrong: 
  * When it's true: 
  * How to fix it: Read in blocks of time. Record what you read. (elaborate on these)

Similar to:

"Just do it" 
  * Example offender: Jeff Atwood post.
  * Why it's wrong: 
  * When it's true:

"Don't memorize"
  * Example offender: Reaction to programming SRS
  * Why it's wrong: cached thoughts -- everything is memorization 
  * When it's true: understanding is good for complex KCs

## Good generalizations

One type of good generalization is a totally correct one. These are really nice! We don't have to relearn calculus for every dimension -- vectors generalize. But generalizing correctly requires great care; in particular, proving the thing in the general case. Of course, that's what made the first part so easy -- all it takes is a counterexample. 

Another type I'm hastily calling a framework. 

Potential examples:
* http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues
* http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/03/27/what-the-hell-is-study-hacks/
* AJATT

Notice these are often vague. They help you "frame" the things you are taking about. They can also be reflected upon as you continue learning the many intricacies of the true pattern. 

It's great that not everything generalizes! The world would be a much more boring place.
