  - **Contiguity Effects**. Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time.
  - **Perceptual-motor Grounding**. Concepts benefit from being grounded in perceptual motor experiences, particularly at early stages of learning.
  - **Dual Code and Multimedia Effects**. Materials presented in verbal, visual, and multimedia form richer representations than a single medium.
  - **Testing Effect**. Testing enhances learning, particularly when the tests are aligned with important content.
  - **Spacing Effect**. Spaced schedules of studying and testing produce better long-term retention than a single study session or test.
  - **Exam Expectations**. Students benefit more from repeated testing when they expect a final exam.
  - **Generation Effect**. Learning is enhanced when learners produce answers compared to having them recognize answers.
  - **Organization Effects**. Outlining, integrating, and synthesizing information produces better learning than rereading materials or other more passive strategies.
  - **Coherence Effect**. Materials and multimedia should explicitly link related ideas and minimize distracting irrelevant material.
  - **Stories and Example Cases**. Stories and example cases tend to be remembered better than didactic facts and abstract principles.
  - **Multiple Examples**. An understanding of an abstract concept improves with multiple and varied examples.
  - **Feedback Effects**. Students benefit from feedback on their performance in a learning task, but the timing of the feedback depends on the task.
  - **Negative Suggestion Effects**. Learning wrong information can be reduced when feedback is immediate.
  - **Desirable difficulties**. Challenges make learning and retrieval effortful and thereby have positive effects on long-term retention.
  - **Manageable Cognitive Load**. The information presented to the learner should not overload working memory.
  - **Segmentation Principle**. A complex lesson should be broken down into manageable subparts.
  - **Explanation Effects**. Students benefit more from constructing deep coherent explanations (mental models) of the material than memorizing shallow isolated facts.
  - **Deep questions**. Students benefit more from asking and answering deep questions that elicit explanations (e.g., why, why not, how, what-if) than shallow questions (e.g., who, what, when, where).
  - **Cognitive Disequilibrium**. Deep reasoning and learning is stimulated by problems that create cognitive disequilibrium, such as obstacles to goals, contradictions, conflict, and anomalies.
  - **Cognitive Flexibility**. Cognitive flexibility improves with multiple viewpoints that link facts, skills, procedures, and deep conceptual principles.
  - **Goldilocks Principle**. Assignments should not be too hard or too easy, but at the right level of difficulty for the studentâ€™s level of skill or prior knowledge.
  - **Imperfect Metacognition**. Students rarely have an accurate knowledge of their cognition so their ability to calibrate their comprehension, learning, and memory should not be trusted.
  - **Discovery Learning**. Most students have trouble discovering important principles on their own, without careful guidance, scaffolding, or materials with well-crafted affordances.
  - **Self-regulated Learning**. Most students need training on how to self-regulate their learning and other cognitive processes. 
  - **Anchored Learning**. Learning is deeper and students are more motivated when the materials and skills are anchored in real world problems that matter to the learne
