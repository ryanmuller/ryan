Man, you just changed my life. I read this, and then started looking through and comparing browswer histories. I work at home, so this can get really bad for me.

Anway, on days when the first thing I did was log into my server to get work done, I basically didn't do anything but work for 10 hours straight. Crazy right.

Days when I check reddit first thing, it looks like I got very little work done. It's amazing how we don't even recognize these things in ourselves.

Thank you citizen. I'm serious, you may have just changed my life.

I'd be careful about assuming a causal relationship when all you're really observing is a correlation... Try flipping a coin every day to decide what you're going to start with. Then, if you still see the same pattern, you'll know you're on to something.

Ah, that makes sense, as in, days that I start off jacking around, I was already predisposed to not getting much done, whereas on days when I start off being productive, I woke up predisposed to being productive, so I started right away, instead of starting right away being the thing that put me in a productive state of mind?

that's the other plausible theory, and what you've observed doesn't help you choose between the two.
